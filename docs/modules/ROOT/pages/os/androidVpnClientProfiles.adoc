= VPN Profile Import for the Android VPN Client

:COLS:    cols="1,3,9"
:JSON:    https://json.org
:IETF:    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html
:RFC4122: {IETF}/rfc4122
:RFC7427: {IETF}/rfc7427

Since version xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_8_0_2017_01_20[1.8.0] of the
xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc[strongSwan VPN Client for Android] it is possible to
import VPN profiles from JSON files.

== Deployment

The app will open `*http[s]://*` URLs to `*.sswan*` files. It also opens any file
with a media type of `*application/vnd.strongswan.profile*` (the file extension
doesn't matter in that case). The latter should also work for email attachments
if the MIME media type is set accordingly.

Whether downloaded files for which the media type is not correct but the extension
is `*.sswan*` can be opened depends on the app that starts the `*Intent*`. For
instance from Android's default Downloads app it won't work due to the
`*content://*` URLs that do not contain the original file name (it works if the
media type was set correctly by the web server), but when e.g. opening the
downloaded file from within Chrome's Downloads view it works as these `*Intents*`
use `*file://*` URLs that contain the complete file name.

Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0] it is possible to
browse for profile files via SAF (Storage Access Framework), which should also
work if the file extension and/or media type is not correct. Note that after
importing the profile the user is able to edit it freely.

== File Format

The file format is based on {JSON}[JSON]. The expected encoding is UTF-8. The
top-level element in the file is an object that may (or must) contain the
following keys. Keys of sub-objects are separated with dots.

[{COLS}]
|===
|Required |Key |Description

|`*x*` |`*uuid*`
|Unique identifier to identify the VPN profile. The format is defined in
 {RFC4122}[RFC 4122]. Version 4 UUIDs (random-generated) are recommended and
 may be created e.g. with the command `*uuid -v4*`. If a VPN profile with the same
 UUID already exists, its settings are replaced when the profile is imported

|`*x*` |`name`
|Display name of the profile

|`*x*` |`type`
|Type of the VPN profile. The following values are currently supported and
 determine the type of client authentication that is used (the server is always
 authenticated with a certificate): +
`*ikev2-eap*`: Username/password-based EAP authentication +
`*ikev2-cert*`: Certificate authentication +
`*ikev2-cert-eap*`: Certificate authentication followed by a
  username/password-based EAP authentication +
`*ikev2-eap-tls*`: EAP-TLS certificate authentication +
`*ikev2-byod-eap*`: EAP-TNC with username/password-based EAP authentication +
Some of the keys described below are only relevant for certain types

|      |`apps`
|Optional array of package names (e.g. `*com.example.app.name`*) of apps that are
 able to use this VPN connection. For all other apps it will look as if there was
 no VPN. Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`excluded-apps`
|Optional array of package names (e.g. `*com.example.app.name*`) of apps that won't
 be able to use this VPN connection. It will look to them as if there was no VPN.
 Only relevant if `*apps*` is not set.
 Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`ike-proposal`
|Optional custom IKE proposal, i.e. a list of crypto algorithm identifiers separated
 by hyphens. For non-AEAD/classic encryption algorithms an integrity algorithm,
 a pseudo random function (optional, defaults to one based on the integrity
 algorithm) and a Diffie-Hellman group are required (e.g. `*aes256-sha256-ecp256*`).
 For combined-mode/AEAD algorithms the integrity algorithm is omitted but a PRF
 is required (e.g. `*aes256gcm16-prfsha256-ecp256*`).
 Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_5_2017_11_17[1.9.5]

|      |`esp-proposal`
|Optional custom ESP proposal, i.e. a list of crypto algorithm identifiers separated
 by hyphens. For non-AEAD/classic encryption algorithms, an integrity algorithm is
 required, a Diffie-Hellman group is optional (e.g. `*aes256-sha256*` or
 `*aes256-sha256-ecp256*`). For combined-mode/AEAD algorithms, the integrity
 algorithm is omitted (e.g. `*aes256gcm16*` or `*aes256gcm16-ecp256*`). If a DH
 group is specified IPsec SA rekeying will use a DH key exchange. However, DH groups
 specified here are not used when the connection is established initially because
 the keys there are derived from the IKE SA key material. Therefore any configuration
 mismatch with the server will only cause errors later during rekeying.

|      |`mtu`
|Optional MTU to use for the TUN device

|      |`nat-keepalive`
|Optional interval for
 xref:features/natTraversal.adoc#_nat_t_keepalives[NAT-T keepalive] packets.
 Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`dns-servers`
|Optional array or space-separated list of DNS server addresses to use instead of
 those received by the VPN server.
 Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_1_0_2019_03_14[2.1.0]

|      |`ipv6-transport`
|Whether to use IPv6 transport addresses for IKE and ESP if available. Requires
 support for UDP encapsulation for IPv6 on the server (the Linux kernel only
 supports this since 5.8).
 Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_3_1_2020_10_29[2.3.1]

=== remote

Mandatory object containing information about the server. The following attributes
are defined:

[{COLS}]
|===
|Required |Key |Description

|`*x*` |`addr`
|The server's hostname or IP address. If no remote identity is configured this has
 to be contained as `*subjectAltName*` extension in the server certificate

|      |`port`
|Optional server port (default is `*500*`)

|      |`id`
|Optional IKE identity of the server. If this is not configured it defaults to
 `*addr*` and no `*IDr*` is sent in the IKE_AUTH request

|      |`cert`
|Optional Base64-encoded CA or server certificate. Is imported into the app, not
 the system keystore. If not set, automatic CA certificate selection is enabled.
 Thus it's not necessary if the server certificate is issued by a CA the client
 already trusts or if the PKCS#12-file below contains the complete certificate
 chain (this might cause warnings on older Android releases, though, see
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_client_configuration[Android VPN client configuration]
 for details)

|      |`certreq`
|Whether to send certificate requests for all installed or selected CA certificates.
 Disabling this may reduce the size of the IKE_AUTH message if the server does not
 support fragmentation. But it only works if the server doesn't require certificate
 requests to send back the server certificate. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`revocation`
|Optional object that sets the revocation checking policy for the remote certificate

|      |`revocation.crl`
|Whether to use CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) if available for revocation
 checking of the remote certificate. CRLs are only used if OCSP doesn't yield a
 result. Enabled by default. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0]

|      |`revocation.ocsp`
|Whether to use OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) if available for
 revocation checking of the remote certificate. Enabled by default. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0]

|      |`revocation.strict`
|In strict mode the authentication will fail if the status of the remote certificate
 is unknown (e.g. because no valid CRL was available). Disabled by default. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0]
|===

=== local

Optional object containing information about the client. The following attributes
are defined:

[{COLS}]
|===
|Required |Key |Description

|      |`eap_id`
|Optional identity/username for EAP authentication. If this is required (for
 username/password-based EAP authentication) but not configured here, the user is
 prompted for it when importing the profile. If it is set the user is not able to
 change it while importing (but may later do so). In both cases the user may
 optionally enter the password while importing the profile

|      |`id`
|Optional IKE identity of the client for certificate authentication and since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_2_0_2019_10_15[2.2.0] also for other authentication
 types. Typically has to match a `*subjectAltName*` contained in the client
 certificate if one is used. Must not be configured if the certificate's subject
 DN shall be used as client identity

|      |`p12`
|Optional Base64-encoded PKCS#12-container with the client certificate and private
 key and optional certificate chain (the latter might cause warnings on older
 Android releases, see
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_client_configuration[Android VPN client configuration]
 for details). Not necessary for username/password-based EAP authentication or if
 the user already has the certificate/key installed as it may be selected while
 importing the profile

|      |`rsa-pss`
|Whether to use the stronger PSS encoding instead of the classic PKCS#1 encoding
 for RSA signatures during {RFC7427}[RFC 7427] signature authentication. Disabled
 by default. May be enabled if the server supports it. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_2_0_0_2018_07_03[2.0.0]
|===

=== split-tunneling

Optional object containing split-tunneling settings. The following attributes
are defined:

[{COLS}]
|===
|Required |Key |Description

|      |`subnets`
|An array of subnets (in CIDR notation), IP addresses or ranges (IP-IP) to route
 via VPN. All other traffic is forwarded as if there was no VPN. This is only
 relevant locally, these subnets are not sent to the server. Since
 xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`excluded`
|An array of subnets (in CIDR notation), IP addresses or ranges (IP-IP) to exclude
 from the VPN. Matching traffic is forwarded as if there was no VPN. This is only
 relevant locally. Since xref:./androidVpnClient.adoc#_1_9_0_2017_07_03[1.9.0]

|      |`block-ipv4`
|Whether to block IPv4 traffic that's not destined for the VPN. Forces all IPv4
 traffic via VPN (traffic that does not match the negotiated traffic selector is
 then just dropped). Thus this is basically equivalent to including `*0.0.0.0/0*`
 in `*subnets*`

|      |`block-ipv6`
|Whether to block IPv6 traffic that's not destined for the VPN. Forces all IPv6
traffic via VPN (traffic that does not match the negotiated traffic selector is
then just dropped). Thus this is basically equivalent to including `*::/0*` in
`*subnets*`
