== Overview

The `*swanctl.conf*` file provides connections, secrets and IP address pools for
the xref:swanctl/swanctl.adoc[`*swanctl --load-**`] commands.

The file uses a xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_syntax[`*strongswan.conf*`]-style
syntax (referencing sections, since version 5.7.0, and including other files is
supported as well) and is located in the xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl*`]
configuration directory, usually `*/etc/swanctl*`.

Many examples can be found in our testing environment, eg. as used by the
{TESTS}/ikev2[IKEv2 scenarios].

== Keys

=== authorities

Section defining complementary attributes of certification authorities, each in
its own subsection with an arbitrary yet unique name (denoted `<name>` below).

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description

|<name>.cacert             |
|The certificates may use a relative path from the
 xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl/x509ca*`] directory or an absolute path.
 Configure one of `*cacert*`, `*file*`, or `*handle*` per section

|<name>.file               |
|Absolute path to the certificate to load. Passed as-is to the daemon, so it must
 be readable by it.
 Configure one of `*cacert*`, `*file*`, or `*handle*` per section

|<name>.handle             |
|Hex-encoded `CKA_ID` or handle of the CA certificate on a token or
 xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[TPM 2.0], respectively.
 Configure one of `*cacert*`, `*file*`, or `*handle*` per section

|<name>.slot               |
|Optional slot number of the token that stores the CA certificate

|<name>.module             |
|Optional PKCS#11 module name

|<name>.cert_uri_base      |
|Defines the base URI for the Hash and URL feature supported by IKEv2. Instead of
 exchanging complete certificates, IKEv2 allows one to send an URI that resolves
 to the DER encoded certificate. The certificate URIs are built by appending the
 SHA1 hash of the DER encoded certificates to this base URI

|<name>.crl_uris           |
|Comma-separated list of CRL distribution points (ldap, http, or file URI)

|<name>.ocsp_uris          |
|Comma-separated list of OCSP URIs
|===

=== connections

Section defining IKE connection configurations, each in its own subsection with
an arbitrary yet unique name (denoted `<conn>` below).

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description [default]

|<conn>.version            |`0`
|IKE major version to use for connection. `*1*` uses IKEv1 aka ISAKMP, `*2*` uses
 IKEv2. A connection using the default of `*0*` accepts both IKEv1 and IKEv2 as
 a responder and initiates the connection actively with IKEv2

|<conn>.local_addrs        |`%any`
|Local [comma-separated] address[es] to use for IKE communication. Accepts single
 IPv4/IPv6 addresses, DNS names, CIDR subnets or IP address ranges. As an initiator,
 the first non-range/non-subnet is used to initiate the connection from. As a
 responder the local destination address must match at least to one of the
 specified addresses, subnets or ranges. If FQDNs are assigned, they are resolved
 every time a configuration lookup is done. If DNS resolution times out, the
 lookup is delayed for that time

|<conn>.remote_addrs       |`%any`
|Remote [comma-separated] address[es] to use for IKE communication. Accepts single
 IPv4/IPv6 addresses, DNS names, CIDR subnets or IP address ranges. As an initiator,
 the first non-range/non-subnet is used to initiate the connection to. As a
 responder, the initiator source address must match at least to one of the
 specified addresses, subnets or ranges. If FQDNs are assigned they are resolved
 every time a configuration lookup is done. If DNS resolution times out, the
 lookup is delayed for that time. To initiate a connection, at least one specific
 address or DNS name must be specified

|<conn>.local_port         |`500`
|Local UDP port for IKE communication. By default the port of the socket backend
 is used, which is usually `*500*`. If port `*500*` is used, automatic IKE port
 floating to port `*4500*` is used to work around NAT issues. Using a non-default
 local IKE port requires support from the socket backend, i.e. use  the
 `*socket-dynamic*` plugin

|<conn>.remote_port        |`500`
|Remote UDP port for IKE communication. If the default of port `*500*` is used,
 automatic IKE port floating to port `*4500*` is used to work around NAT issues

|<conn>.proposals          |[->]
|A proposal is a set of algorithms. For non-AEAD algorithms this includes IKE an
 encryption algorithm, an integrity algorithm, a pseudo random function (PRF) and
 a Diffie-Hellman key exchange group. For AEAD algorithms, instead of encryption
 and integrity algorithms a combined algorithm is used. With IKEv2 multiple
 algorithms of the same kind can be specified in a single proposal, from which one
 gets selected. For IKEv1 only one algorithm per kind is allowed per proposal,
 more algorithms get implicitly stripped. Use multiple proposals to offer different
 algorithm combinations with IKEv1. Algorithm keywords get separated using dashes.
 Multiple proposals may be separated by commas. The special value `*default*`
 adds a default proposal of supported algorithms considered safe and is usually
 a good choice for interoperability. [`default`]

|<conn>.vips               |
|Comma-separated list of virtual IPs to request in IKEv2 configuration payloads
 or IKEv1 ModeConfig. The wildcard addresses `*0.0.0.0*` and `*::*` request an
 arbitrary address, specific addresses may be defined. The responder may return
 a different address, though, or none at all

|<conn>.aggressive         |`no`
|Enables IKEv1 Aggressive Mode instead of IKEv1 Main Mode with Identity Protection.
 Aggressive Mode is considered less secure because the ID and HASH payloads are
 exchanged unprotected. This allows a passive attacker to snoop peer identities
 and even worse, start dictionary attacks on the Preshared Key

|<conn>.pull               |`yes`
|If the default of `*yes*` is used, ModeConfig works in *pull* mode where the
 initiator actively requests a virtual IP. With `*no*` *push* mode is used where
 the responder pushes down a virtual IP to the initiating peer. `*Push* mode is
 currently supported for IKEv1 but not for IKEv2. It is used by a few
 implementations only, so that *pull* mode is recommended

|<conn>.dscp               |[->]
|Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) to set on outgoing IKE packets for this
 connection. The value is a six digit binary encoded string specifying the
 Codepoint to set, as defined in {RFC2474}[RFC 2474]. [`000000`]

|<conn>.encap              |`no`
|To enforce UDP encapsulation of ESP packets, the IKE daemon can manipulate the
 NAT detection payloads. This makes the peer believe that a NAT situation exist
 on the transmission path, forcing it to encapsulate ESP packets in UDP. Usually
 this is not required but it can help to work around connectivity issues with too
 restrictive intermediary firewalls that block ESP packets

|<conn>.mobike             |`yes`
|Enables {RFC4555}[MOBIKE] on IKEv2 connections. {RFC4555}[MOBIKE] is enabled by
 default on IKEv2 connections and allows mobility of clients and multi-homing on
 servers by migrating active IPsec tunnels. Usually keeping {RFC4555}[MOBIKE]
 enabled is unproblematic, as it is not used if the peer does not indicate support
 for it. However, due to the design of {RFC4555}[MOBIKE], IKEv2 always floats to
 UDP port `*4500*` starting from the second exchange. Some implementations don't
 like this behavior, hence it can be disabled

|<conn>.dpd_delay          |`0s`
|Interval to check the liveness of a peer actively using IKEv2 `INFORMATIONAL`
 exchanges or IKEv1 `R_U_THERE` messages. Active DPD checking is only enforced if
 no IKE or ESP/AH packet has been received for the configured DPD delay

|<conn>.dpd_timeout        |`0s`
|Charon by default uses the normal retransmission mechanism and timeouts to check
 the liveness of a peer, as all messages are used for liveness checking. For
 compatibility reasons, with IKEv1 a custom interval may be specified. This option
 has no effect on IKEv2 connections

|<conn>.fragmentation      |`yes`
|Use IKE fragmentation (proprietary IKEv1 extension or {RFC7383}[RFC 7383] IKEv2
 fragmentation).  Acceptable  values  are `*yes*` (the default since version 5.5.1),
 `*accept*` (since version 5.5.3), `*force*` and `*no*`. If set to `*yes*` and the
 peer supports it, oversized IKE messages will be sent in fragments. If set to
 `*accept*`, support for fragmentation is announced to the peer but the daemon
 does not send its own messages in fragments.  If set  to `*force*` (only
 supported for IKEv1) the initial IKE message will already be fragmented if
 required. Finally, setting the option to `*no*` will disable announcing support
 for this feature. Note that fragmented IKE messages sent by a peer are always
 processed irrespective of the value of this option, i.e. even when set to `*no*`

|<conn>.childless          |`allow`
|Since version 5.8.0. Use childless IKE_SA initiation ({RFC6023}[RFC 6023]) for
 IKEv2. Acceptable values are `*allow*` (the default), `*force*` and `*never*`.
 If set to `*allow*`, responders will accept childless IKE_SAs (as indicated via
 notify in the IKE_SA_INIT response) while initiators continue to create regular
 IKE_SAs with the first CHILD_SA created during IKE_AUTH, unless the IKE_SA is
 initiated explicitly without any children (which will fail if the responder does
 not support or has disabled this extension).  If set to `*force*`, only childless
 initiation is accepted and the first CHILD_SA is created with a separate
 `CREATE_CHILD_SA` exchange (e.g. to use an independent DH exchange for all
 CHILD_SAs). Finally, setting the option to `*never*`, disables support for
 childless IKE_SAs as responder

|<conn>.send_certreq       |`yes`
|Send certificate request payloads to offer trusted root CA certificates to the
 peer. Certificate requests help the peer to choose an appropriate
 certificate/private key for authentication and are enabled by default. Disabling
 certificate requests can be useful if too many trusted root CA certificates are
 installed, as each certificate request increases the size of the initial IKE
 packets

|<conn>.send_cert          |[->]
|Send certificate payloads when using certificate authentication. With the default
 of `*ifasked*` the daemon sends certificate payloads only if certificate requests
 have been received. `*never*` disables sending of certificate payloads altogether
 whereas `*always*` causes certificate payloads to be sent unconditionally whenever
 certificate-based authentication is used. [`ifasked`]

|<conn>.ppk_id             |
|Since version 5.7.0. String identifying the Postquantum Preshared Key (PPK,
 {RFC8784}[RFC 8784]) to be used

|<conn>.ppk_required       |`no`
|Since version 5.7.0. Whether a Postquantum Preshared Key (PPK, {RFC8784}[RFC 8784])
 is required for this connection

|<conn>.keyingtries        |`1`
|Number of retransmission sequences to perform during initial connect. Instead of
 giving up initiation after the first retransmission sequence with the default
 value of `*1*`, additional sequences may be started according to the configured
 value. A value of `*0*` initiates a new sequence until the connection establishes
 or fails with a permanent error

|<conn>.unique             |`no`
|Connection uniqueness policy to enforce. To avoid multiple connections from the
 same user, a uniqueness policy can be enforced. The value `*never*` does never
 enforce such a policy, even if a peer included `INITIAL_CONTACT` notification
 messages, whereas `*no*` replaces existing connections for the same identity if
 a new one has the `INITIAL_CONTACT` notify. `*keep*` rejects new connection
 attempts if the same user already has an active connection. `*replace*` deletes
 any existing connection if a new one for the same user gets established. To
 compare connections for uniqueness, the remote IKE identity is used. If EAP or
 XAuth authentication is involved, the EAP-Identity or XAuth username is used to
 enforce the uniqueness policy instead. On initiators this setting specifies
 whether an `INITIAL_CONTACT` notify is sent during `IKE_AUTH` if no existing
 connection is found with the remote peer (determined by the identities of the
 first authentication round). Unless set to `*never*` the client will send a
 notify

include::partial$config/swanctl-rekey-ike.adoc[]

|<conn>.pools              |
|Comma-separated list of named IP pools to allocate virtual IP addresses and other
 configuration attributes from. Each name references a pool by name from either
 the `*pools*` section or an external pool. Note that the order in which they are
 queried primarily depends on the plugin order. Only if pools are provided by the
 same backend does the order matter

|<conn>.if_id_in           |`0`
|Since version 5.8.0. XFRM interface ID set on inbound policies/SA. Can be
 overridden by child config, see there for details.
 +
 The special value `*%unique*` allocates a unique interface ID per IKE_SA,
 which is inherited by all its CHILD_SAs (unless overriden there), beyond
 that the value `*%unique-dir*` assigns a different unique interface ID for
 each direction (`*in/out*`)

|<conn>.if_id_out          |`0`
|Since version 5.8.0. XFRM interface ID set on outbound policies/SA. Can be
 overridden by child config, see there for details.
 +
 The special value `*%unique*` allocates a unique interface ID per IKE_SA,
 which is inherited by all its CHILD_SAs (unless overriden there), beyond
 that the value `*%unique-dir*` assigns a different unique interface ID for
 each direction (`*in/out*`)

|<conn>.mediation          |`no`
|Since version 5.5.2. Whether this connection is a mediation connection, i.e.
 whether this connection is used to mediate other connections using the IKEv2
 Mediation Extension.  Mediation connections create no CHILD_SA

|<conn>.mediated_by        |
|Since version 5.5.2. The name of the connection to mediate this connection
 through. If given, the connection will be mediated through the named mediation
 connection. The mediation connection must have `*mediation*` enabled

|<conn>.mediation_peer     |
|Since version 5.5.2. Identity under which the peer is registered at the mediation
 server, i.e. the IKE identity the other end of this connection uses as its local
 identity on its connection to the mediation server. This is the identity we
 request the mediation server to mediate us with. Only relevant on connections that
 set `*mediated_by*`. If it is not given, the remote IKE identity of the first
 authentication round of this connection will be used
|===

==== connections.<conn>.local

Section for a local authentication round. A local authentication round defines
the rules how authentication is performed for the local peer. Multiple rounds may
be defined to use IKEv2 Multiple Authentication ({RFC4739}[RFC 4739]) or IKEv1
XAuth. Each round is defined in a section having `*local*` as prefix and an
optional unique `<suffix>` as e.g. in `*local-xauth*` or `*local2*`. To define
a single authentication round, only, the`<suffix>` may be omitted.

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description [default]

|round                     |`0`
|Since version 5.4.0. Optional numeric identifier by which authentication rounds
 are sorted. If not specified, rounds are ordered by their position in the config
 file or xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] message

|auth                      |[->]
|Authentication to perform locally. `*pubkey*` uses public key authentication based
 on a private key associated with a usable certificate. `*psk*` uses pre-shared key
 authentication. The IKEv1 specific `*xauth*` is used for XAuth or Hybrid
 authentication while the IKEv2 specific `*eap*` keyword defines EAP authentication.
 +
 For `*xauth*` a specific backend name may be appended, separated by a dash. The
 appropriate `*xauth*` backend is selected to perform the XAuth exchange. For
 traditional XAuth, the `*xauth*` method is usually defined in the second
 authentication round following an initial `*pubkey*` or `*psk*` round. Using
 `*xauth*` in the first round performs Hybrid Mode client authentication.
 +
 For `*eap*` a specific EAP method name may be appended, separated by a dash. An EAP
 module implementing the appropriate method is selected to perform the EAP
 conversation.
 +
 Since version 5.4.0, if both peers support IKEv2 Signature Authentication
 ({RFC7427}[RFC 7427]), specific hash algorithms to be used during IKEv2
 authentication may be configured. To do so use `*ike:*` followed by a trust
 chain signature scheme constraint (see description of the `*auth*` keyword
 in the xref:#_connections_conn_remote[`*remote*`] section).
 +
 For example with `*ike:pubkey-sha384-sha256*`, a public key signature scheme
 with either SHA-384 or SHA-256 would get used for authentication, in that order
 and depending on the hash algorithms supported by the peer. If no specific hash
 algorithms are configured, the default is to prefer an algorithm that matches or
 exceeds the strength of the signature key. If no constraints with `*ike:*` prefix
 are configured, any signature scheme constraint (without `*ike:*` prefix) will
 also apply to IKEv2 authentication, unless this is disabled in
 xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. To use `RSASSA-PSS`
 signatures use `*rsa/pss*` instead of `*pubkey*` or `*rsa*` as e.g. in
 `*ike:rsa/pss-sha256*`. If `*pubkey*` or `*rsa*` constraints are configured,
 `RSASSA-PSS` signatures will only be used if enabled in
 xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. [`pubkey`]

|id                        |
|IKE identity to use for authentication round. When using certificate authentication.
 The IKE identity must be contained in the certificate, either as the subject DN
 or as a subjectAltName (the identity will default to the certificate's subject
 DN if not specified). Refer to xref:config/identityParsing.adoc[identity parsing]
 for details on how identities are parsed and may be configured

|eap_id                    |`id`
|Client EAP-Identity to use in EAP-Identity exchange and the EAP method

|aaa_id                    |[->]
|Server side EAP-Identity to expect in the EAP method. Some EAP methods, such as
 EAP-TLS, use an identity for the server to perform mutual authentication. This
 identity may differ from the IKE identity, especially when EAP authentication is
 delegated from the IKE responder to an AAA backend. For EAP-(T)TLS this defines
 the identity for which the server must provide a certificate in the TLS exchange.
 [`remote.id`]

|xauth_id                  |`id`
|Client XAuth username used in the XAuth exchange

|certs                     |
|Comma-separated list of certificate candidates to use for authentication. The
 certificates may use a relative path from the
 xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl/x509*`] directory or an absolute path.
 The certificate used for authentication is selected based on the received
 certificate request payloads. If no appropriate CA can be located, the first
 certificate is used

include::partial$config/swanctl-local-cert.adoc[]

|pubkeys                   |
|Since version 5.4.0. Comma-separated list of raw public key candidates to use for
 authentication. The public keys may use a relative path from the
 xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl/pubkey*`] directory or an absolute path.
 Even though multiple local public keys could be defined in principle, only the
 first public key in the list is used for authentication.
|===

==== connections.<conn>.remote

Section for a remote authentication round. A remote authentication round defines
the constraints how the peers must authenticate to use this connection. Multiple
rounds may be defined to use IKEv2 Multiple Authentication ({RFC4739}[RFC 4739]
or IKEv1 XAuth. Each round is defined in a section having `*remote*` as prefix
and an optional unique `<suffix>` as e.g. in `*remote-xauth*` or `*remote2*`.
To define a single authentication round, only, the `<suffix>` may be omitted.

[{COLS}]
|===
|Key |Default| Description [default]

|round                     |`0`
|Since version 5.4.0. Optional numeric identifier by which authentication rounds
 are sorted. If not specified, rounds are ordered by their position in the config
 file or xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] message

|auth                      |[->]
|Authentication to expect from remote. See the description of the `*auth*` keyword
 in the xref:#_connections_conn_local[`*local*`] section about the details of
 supported mechanisms.
 +
 Since version 5.4.0, to require a trust chain public key strength for the remote
 side, specify the key type followed by the minimum strength in bits (e.g.
 `*ecdsa-384*` or `*rsa-2048-ecdsa-256*`). To limit the acceptable set of hashing
 algorithms for trust chain validation, append hash algorithms to `*pubkey*` or a
 key strength definition (e.g. `*pubkey-sha256-sha512*`,
 `*rsa-2048-sha256-sha384-sha512*` or `*rsa-2048-sha256-ecdsa-256-sha256-sha384*`).
 Unless disabled in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] or if
 explicit IKEv2 signature constraints are configured, such key types and hash
 algorithms are also applied as constraints against IKEv2 signature authentication
 schemes used by the remote side.
 +
 To require `RSASSA-PSS` signatures use `*rsa/pss*` instead of `*pubkey*`
 or `*rsa*` as e.g. in `*rsa/pss-sha256*`. If `*pubkey*` or `*rsa*` constraints
 are configured `RSASSA-PSS*` signatures will only be accepted if enabled in
 xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. To specify trust chain
 constraints for EAP-(T)TLS, append a colon to the EAP method, followed by the
 key type/size and hash algorithm as discussed above (e.g.
 `*eap-tls:ecdsa-384-sha384*`). [`pubkey`]

|id                        |`%any`
|IKE identity to expect for authentication round. Refer to the `*id*` keyword
 of the xref:#_connections_conn_local[`*local*`] section for details. When using
 certificate-based authentication, the IKE identity must be contained in the
 certificate, either as the subject DN or as a subjectAltName. It's possible to
 use wildcards to match remote identities (e.g. `*{STAR}@strongswan.org*`,
 `*{STAR}.strongswan.org*` or `*"C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN={STAR}"*`). Connections
 with exact matches are preferred. When using DNs with wildcards, the
 `*charon.rdn_matching*` option in
 xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] specifies how Relative
 Distinguished Names (RDNs) are matched

|eap_id                    |`id`
|Identity to use as peer identity during EAP authentication. If set to `*%any*`
 the EAP-Identity method will be used to ask the client for an EAP identity

|groups                    |
|Comma-separated authorization group memberships to require. The peer must prove
 membership to at least one of the specified groups. Group membership can be
 certified by different means, e.g. by appropriate Attribute Certificates or by
 an AAA backend involved in the authentication

|cert_policy               |
|Since version 5.5.2. Comma-separated list of certificate policy OIDs the peer's
 certificate must have. OIDs are specified using the numerical dotted
 representation

|certs                     |
|Comma separated list of certificates to accept for authentication. The certificates
 may use a relative path from the xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl/x509*`]
 directory or an absolute path

|cert<suffix>              |
|Since version 5.5.2. Subsection for a certificate candidate to use for
 authentication. Certificates in `*certs*` are transmitted as binary blobs whereas
 the `*cert*` subsections offer more flexibility

|cert<suffix>.file         |
|Absolute path to the certificate to load. Passed as-is to the daemon, so it must
 be readable by it. Configure either `*file*` or `*handle*` but not both in one
 section

|cert<suffix>.handle       |
|Hex-encoded `CKA_ID` or handle of the certificate on a token or
 xref:tpm/tpm2.adoc[TPM 2.0], respectively. Configure either `*handle*` or `*file*`

|Optional slot number of the token that stores the certificate

|cacert<suffix>.module     |
|Optional PKCS#11 module name

|ca_id                     |
|Since version 5.8.2. Identity in CA certificate to accept for authentication.
 The specified identity must be contained in one (intermediate) CA of the remote
 peer trustchain, either as the subject DN or as a subjectAltName. This has the
 same effect as specifying `*cacerts*` to force clients under a CA to specific
 connections. It does not require the CA certificate to be available locally and
 can be received from the peer during the IKE exchange

|pubkeys                   |

|revocation                |[->]
|Certificate revocation policy for CRL or OCSP revocation. A `*strict*` revocation
 policy fails if no revocation information is available, i.e. the certificate is
 not known to be unrevoked. `*ifuri*` fails only if a CRL/OCSP URI is available
 but certificate revocation checking fails, i.e. there should be revocation
 information available, but it could not be obtained. The default revocation
 policy `*relaxed*` fails only if a certificate is revoked, i.e. it is explicitly
 known that it is bad. [`relaxed`]

==== connections.<conn>.children

CHILD_SA configuration subsection. Each connection definition may have one or
more sections in its `*children*` subsection. The section name defines the name
of the CHILD_SA configuration, which must be unique within the connection
(denoted `<child>` below).

[{COLS}]

|Key |Default| Description [default]

|<child>.ah_proposals      |
|AH proposals to offer for the CHILD_SA. A proposal is a set of algorithms. For AH
 this includes an integrity algorithm and an optional Diffie-Hellman group. If a
 DH group is specified, CHILD_SA/Quick Mode rekeying and initial negotiation uses
 a separate Diffie-Hellman exchange using the specified group (refer to
 `*esp_proposals*` for details).
 +
 For IKEv2 multiple algorithms of the same kind can be specified in a single
 proposal, from which one gets selected. For IKEv1 only one algorithm per kind is
 allowed per proposal. Additional algorithms are implicitly stripped. Use multiple
 proposals to offer different algorithms combinations for IKEv1.
 +
 Algorithm keywords get separated using dashes. Multiple proposals may be separated
 by commas. The special value `*default*` forms a default proposal of supported
 algorithms considered safe and is usually a good choice for interoperability.
 By default no AH proposals are included, instead ESP is proposed

|<child>.esp_proposals     |[->]
|ESP proposals to offer for the CHILD_SA. A proposal is a set of algorithms. For
 ESP non-AEAD proposals this includes an integrity algorithm, an encryption
 algorithm, an optional Diffie-Hellman group and an optional Extended Sequence
 Number Mode (ESN) indicator. For AEAD proposals, a combined mode algorithm is
 used instead of the separate encryption/integrity algorithms.
 +
 If a DH group is specified, CHILD_SA/Quick Mode rekeying and initial negotiation
 use a separate Diffie-Hellman exchange using the specified group. However, for
 IKEv2, the keys of the CHILD_SA created implicitly with the IKE_SA will always be
 derived from the IKE_SA's key material. So any DH group specified here will only
 apply when the CHILD_SA is later rekeyed or is created with a separate
 `CREATE_CHILD_SA` exchange. A proposal mismatch might therefore not immediately
 be noticed when the SA is established, but may later cause rekeying to fail.
 +
 Extended Sequence Number support may be indicated with the `*esn*` and `*noesn*`
 values. Both may be included to indicate support for both modes. If omitted,
 `*noesn*` is assumed.
 +
 For IKEv2 multiple algorithms of the same kind can be specified in a single
 proposal, from which one gets selected. For IKEv1 only one algorithm per kind is
 allowed per proposal. Additional algorithms are implicitly stripped. Use multiple
 proposals to offer different algorithms combinations for IKEv1. Algorithm keywords
 get separated using dashes. Multiple proposals may be separated by commas. The
 special value `*default*` forms a default proposal of supported algorithms
 considered safe and is usually a good choice for interoperability. If no
 algorithms are specified for AH nor ESP, the `*default*` set of algorithms for ESP
 is included. [`default`]

|<child>.sha256_96         |`no`
|Since version 5.5.3. HMAC-SHA-256 is used with 128-bit truncation with IPsec.
 For compatibility with implementations that incorrectly use 96-bit truncation
 this option may be enabled to configure the shorter truncation length in the
 kernel. This is not negotiated, so this only works with peers that use the
 incorrect truncation length (or have this option enabled)

|<child>.local_ts          |[->]
|Comma-separated list of local traffic selectors to include in CHILD_SA. Each
 selector is a CIDR subnet definition, followed by an optional proto/port selector.
 The special value `*dynamic*` may be used instead of a subnet definition, which
 gets replaced by the tunnel outer address or the virtual IP if negotiated. This
 is the default.
 +
 A protocol/port selector is surrounded by opening and closing square brackets.
 Between these brackets, a numeric or `*getservent(3)*` protocol name may be
 specified. After the optional protocol restriction, an optional port restriction
 may be specified, separated by a slash. The port restriction may be numeric, a
 `*getservent(3)*` service name, or the special value `*opaque*` for
 {RFC4301}[RFC 4301] OPAQUE selectors. Port ranges may be specified as well, none
 of the kernel backends currently support port ranges, though.
 +
 When IKEv1 is used, only the first selector is interpreted, except if the Cisco
 Unity extension plugin xref:plugins/unity.adoc[`*unity*`] is used. This is due
 to a limitation of the IKEv1 protocol, which only allows a single pair of
 selectors per CHILD_SA. So to tunnel traffic matched by several pairs of selectors
 when using IKEv1 several children (CHILD_SAs) have to be defined that cover the
 selectors. The IKE daemon uses traffic selector narrowing for IKEv1, the same way
 it is standardized and implemented for IKEv2. However, this may lead to problems
 with other implementations. To avoid that, configure identical selectors in such
 scenarios. [`dynamic`]

|<child>.remote_ts         |[->]
|Comma separated list of remote selectors to include in CHILD_SA. See `*local_ts*`
 for a description of the selector syntax. [`dynamic`]

|<child>.updown            |
|Updown script to invoke on CHILD_SA up and down events

|<child>.hostaccess        |`no`
|Host access variable to pass to `*updown*` script

|<child>.mode              |[->]
|IPsec Mode to establish CHILD_SA with. `*tunnel*` negotiates the CHILD_SA in
 IPsec Tunnel Mode whereas `*transport*` uses IPsec Transport Mode.
 `*transport_proxy*` signifying the special Mobile IPv6 Transport Proxy Mode.
 `*beet*` is the Bound End to End Tunnel mixture mode working with fixed inner
 addresses without the need to include them in each packet. Both `*transport*`
 and `*beet*` modes are subject to mode negotiation. `*tunnel*` mode is negotiated
 if the preferred mode is not available. `*pass*` and `*drop*` are used to install
 shunt policies which explicitly bypass the defined traffic from IPsec processing
 or drop it, respectively. [`tunnel`]

|<child>.policies         |`yes`
|Since version 5.3.3. Whether to install IPsec policies or not. Disabling this can
 be useful in some scenarios e.g. MIPv6 where policies are not managed by the IKE
 daemon

|<child>.policies_fwd_out |`no`
|Since version 5.5.1. Whether to install outbound FWD IPsec policies or not.
 Enabling this is required in case there is a drop policy that would match and
 block forwarded traffic for this CHILD_SA.

|<child>.dpd_action       |`clear`
|Action to perform for this CHILD_SA on DPD timeout. The default `*clear*` closes
 the CHILD_SA and does not take further action. `*trap*` installs a trap policy,
 which will catch matching traffic and tries to re-negotiate the tunnel
 on-demand (note that this is redundant if `*start_action*` includes `*trap*`.
 `*restart*` immediately tries to re-negotiate the CHILD_SA under a fresh IKE_SA.

|<child>.ipcomp           |`no`
|Enable IPComp compression before encryption. If enabled, IKE tries to negotiate
 IPComp compression to compress ESP payload data prior to encryption

|<child>.inactivity       |`0s`
|Timeout before closing CHILD_SA after inactivity. If no traffic has been processed
 in either direction for the configured timeout, the CHILD_SA gets closed due to
 inactivity. The default value of `*0*` disables inactivity checks

|<child>.reqid            |`0`
|Fixed reqid to use for this CHILD_SA. This might be helpful in some scenarios
 but works only if each CHILD_SA configuration is instantiated not more than once.
 The default of `*0*` uses dynamic reqids, allocated incrementally

|<child>.priority         |`0`
|Since version 5.5.0. Optional fixed priority for IPsec policies. This could be
 useful to install high-priority drop policies. The default of `*0*` uses
 dynamically calculated priorities based on the size of the traffic selectors

|<child>.interface        |
|Since version 5.5.0. Optional interface name to restrict outbound IPsec policies

|<child>.mark_in          |[->]
|Netfilter mark and mask for input traffic. On Linux, Netfilter may require marks
 on each packet to match an SA/policy having that option set. This allows installing
 duplicate policies and enables Netfilter rules to select specific SAs/policies for
 incoming traffic. Note that inbound marks are only set on policies since version
 5.5.2, unless `*mark_in_sa*` is enabled. The special value `*%unique*` sets a
 unique mark on each CHILD_SA instance, beyond that the value `*%unique-dir*`
 assigns a different unique mark for each CHILD_SA direction (in/out) since version
 5.6.0. An additional mask may be appended to the mark separated by `*/*`. The
 default mask if omitted is `*0xffffffff*`. [`0/0x00000000`]

|<child>.mark_in_sa       |`no`
|Since 5.6.1. Whether to set `*mark_in*` on the inbound SA. By default, the inbound
 mark is only set on the inbound policy. The tuple destination address, protocol
 and SPI is unique and the mark is not required to find the correct SA, allowing
 to mark traffic after decryption instead (where more specific selectors may be
 used) to match different policies. Marking packets before decryption is still
 possible, even if no mark is set on the SA

|<child>.mark_out         |[->]
|Netfilter mark and mask for output traffic. On Linux, Netfilter may require marks
 on each packet to match a policy/SA having that option set. This allows installing
 duplicate policies and enables Netfilter rules to select specific policies/SAs for
 outgoing traffic. The special value `*%unique*` sets a unique mark on each CHILD_SA
 instance, beyond that the value `*%unique-dir*` assigns a different unique mark for
 each CHILD_SA direction (in/out) since version 5.6.0. An additional mask may be
 appended to the mark, separated by `*/*`. The default mask if omitted is
 `*0xffffffff*`. [`0/0x00000000`]

|<child>.set_mark_in      |[->]
|Since version 5.7.0. Netfilter mark applied to packets after the inbound IPsec
 SA processed them. This way it's not necessary to mark packets via Netfilter
 before decryption or right afterwards to match policies or process them
 differently (e.g. via policy routing). An additional mask may be appended to the
 mark separated by `*/*`. The default mask if omitted is `*0xffffffff*`. The
 special value `*%same*` uses the value (but not the mask) from `*mark_in*` as
 mark value which can be fixed, `*%unique*` or `*%unique-dir*`. Setting marks via
 XFRM input requires Linux 4.19 or higher. [`0/0x00000000`]

|<child>.set_mark_out     |[->]
|Since version 5.7.0. Netfilter mark applied to packets after the outbound IPsec
 SA processed them. This allows processing ESP packets differently than the
 original traffic (e.g. via policy routing). An additional mask may be appended to
 the mark, separated by `*/*`. The default mask if omitted is `*0xffffffff*`. The
 special value `*%same*` uses the value (but not the mask) from `*mark_out*` as
 mark value which can be fixed, `*%unique*` or `*%unique-dir*`. Setting marks
 via XFRM output is supported since Linux 4.14. Setting a mask requires at least
 Linux 4.19. [`0/0x00000000`]

|<child>.if_id_in         |`0`
|Since version 5.8.0. XFRM interface ID set on inbound policies/SA. This allows
 installing duplicate policies/SAs and associates them with an interface with the
 same ID. The special value `*%unique*` sets a unique interface ID on each CHILD_SA
 instance, beyond that the value `*%unique-dir*` assigns a different unique
 interface ID for each CHILD_SA direction (in/out)

|<child>.if_id_out        |`0`
|Since version 5.8.0. XFRM interface ID set on outbound policies/SA. This allows
 installing duplicate policies/SAs and associates them with an interface with the
 same ID. The special value `*%unique*` sets a unique interface ID on each CHILD_SA
 instance, beyond that the value `*%unique-dir*` assigns a different unique
 interface ID for each CHILD_SA direction (in/out). The daemon will not install
 routes for CHILD_SAs that have this option set

|<child>.label        |
|Since version 5.9.6. Optional security label (e.g. SELinux context), IKEv2 only.
 Refer to `*label_mode*` for details on how labels are processed.

|<child>.label_mode   |[->]
|Since version 5.9.6. Defines the mode in which the configured security label
 is used. The default value of `*system*` selects `*selinux*` if strongSwan was
 built with SELinux support and SELinux is enabled by the kernel, otherwise,
 `*simple*` will be selected.

 If set to `*simple*`, the label will be used as is as an additional
 identifier/selector on the IKEv2 level when negotiating CHILD_SAs and selecting
 configs. Labels are not installed in the kernel and received labels have to
 match exactly.

 If set to `*selinux*`, which is only allowed if SELinux is usable on the system,
 the configured label is expected to be a generic context (e.g.
 `system_u:object_r:ipsec_spd_t:s0`) for which flows, whose context match it
 via `association:polmatch`, will trigger an acquire if no SA exists yet for
 the flow's specific context.  The configured label is installed on trap
 policies, so this should generally be combined with `*trap*` in
 `*start_action*`. However, if the connection is initiated directly, without
 acquire, a childless IKE_SA is established and appropriate trap policies are
 installed on both ends by the xref:plugins/selinux.adoc[selinux plugin].
 Labels received from peers are accepted if they match the configured label via
 `association:polmatch`.

|<child>.tfc_padding      |`0`
|Pads ESP packets with additional data to have a consistent ESP packet size for
 improved Traffic Flow Confidentiality. The padding defines the minimum size of
 all ESP packets sent. The default value of `*0*` disables TFC padding, the special
 value `*mtu*` adds TFC padding to create a packet size equal to the Path Maximum
 Transfer Unit

|<child>.replay_window    |`32`
|IPsec replay window to configure for this CHILD_SA. Larger values than the default
 of `*32*` are supported using the Netlink backend only, a value of `*0*` disables
 IPsec replay protection

|<child>.hw_offload       |`no`
|Enable hardware offload for this CHILD_SA, if supported by the IPsec implementation.
 The value `*yes*` enforces offloading and the installation will fail if it's not
 supported by either kernel or device. The value `*auto*` enables offloading if it's
 supported but the installation does not fail otherwise

|<child>.copy_df          |`yes`
|Since version 5.7.0. Whether to copy the DF bit to the outer IPv4 header in tunnel
 mode. This effectively disables Path MTU discovery (PMTUD). Controlling this
 behavior is not supported by all kernel interfaces

|<child>.copy_ecn         |`yes`
|Since version 5.7.0. Whether to copy the ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)
 header field to/from the outer IP header in tunnel mode. Controlling this behavior
 is not supported by all kernel interfaces

|<child>.copy_dscp        |`out`
|Since version 5.7.0. Whether to copy the DSCP (Differentiated Services Codepoint)
 header field to/from the outer IP header in tunnel mode. The value `*out*` only
 copies the field from the inner to the outer header, the value `*in*` does the
 opposite and only copies the field from the outer to the inner header when
 decapsulating. The value `*yes*` copies the field in both directions and the value
 `*no*` disables copying the field altogether.  Setting this to `*yes*` or `*in*`
 could allow an attacker to adversely affect other traffic at the receiver, which
 is why the default is `*out*`. Controlling this behavior is not supported by all
 kernel interfaces

|<child>.start_action     |`none`
|Action to perform after loading the configuration. The default of `*none*` loads
 the connection only, which then can be manually initiated or used as a responder
 configuration. The value `*trap*` installs a trap policy which triggers the tunnel
 as soon as matching traffic has been detected. The value `*start*` initiates the
 connection actively. Since version 5.9.6 these two modes can be combined with
 `*trap\|start*`, to immediately initiate a connection for which trap policies
 have been installed.

 When unloading or replacing a CHILD_SA configuration having a `*start_action*`
 different from `*none*`, the inverse action is performed. Configurations with
 `*start*` get closed while those with `*trap*` get uninstalled (both happens
 for connections with `*trap\|start*`).

|<child>.close_action     |`none`
|Action to perform after a CHILD_SA gets closed by the peer. The default of `*none*`
 does not take any action. `*trap*` installs a trap policy for the CHILD_SA (note
 that this is redundant if `*start_action*` includes `*trap*`). `*start*` tries
 to immediately re-create the CHILD_SA.

 `*close_action*` does not provide any guarantee that the CHILD_SA is kept alive.
 It acts on explicit close messages only but not on negotiation failures. Use
 trap policies to reliably re-create failed CHILD_SAs
