== Introduction

To avoid UDP datagrams being fragmented, IKEv2 supports the
{RFC7296}#section-3.6[*Hash and URL*] encoding of X.509 certificates. Thus instead
of transmitting the binary DER encoded certificates in the IKE_AUTH exchange, only
a hash value and an URL of each certificate is submitted. This URL has to resolve
to the DER encoded certificate and the hash is a SHA1 digest of that data.

The IKEv2 daemon charon supports both - sending and receiving - of certificates
encoded in this manner. Receiving such payloads requires no special configuration
from the user (except enabling the feature, see next section). Thus it is not
specifically covered in this guide.

=== Example

.strongSwan *Hash and URL* {EX1}[example]
image::a-m-c-w-d.png[topology,372,190,link={EX1}]

In this guide we want to configure a connection between the road warriors `*carol*`
and `*dave*` to the VPN gateway `*moon*`, using certificates issued by the strongSwan
CA and served by the web server `*winnetou*`.

== Enabling Hash and URL

NOTE: Since there are some security concerns about accepting URLs supplied by
      unauthenticated peers and then blindly download whatever there may be,
      *Hash and URL* is currently disabled by default.

To enable {RFC7296}#section-3.6[*Hash and URL*] support in
xref:daemons/charon.adoc[`*charon*`] the following option in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] has to be set
----
charon {
  hash_and_url = yes
}
----

== Configuring the Base URL

The URLs that will be sent by the IPsec peers are built by appending the SHA1 hash
of the DER encoded certificate to a base URL configured in the
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc#_authorities[`*authorities*`] section of
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. The option is `*cert_uri_base*`
and it has to be added to the `*authorities*` section of the CA that issued the
certificate we want to send as {RFC7296}#section-3.6[*Hash and URL*].

NOTE: A peer that sends its certificates as *Hash and URL* still has to have these
      certificates locally available.

On `*carol*` the required CA section might look like this (likewise on `*moon*`
and `*dave*`):
----
authorities {
  strongswan {
    cacert = strongswanCert.pem
    cert_uri_base = http://winnetou.strongswan.org/certs/
  }
}
----
The URLs will then be built by concatenating the value of `*cert_uri_base*` and
the SHA1 hash of the DER encoded certificate (see an example later on).

== Preparing the Certificates

Next the certificates have to be prepared and uploaded to the web server `*winnetou*`.
If the X.509 certificates provided, are PEM encoded they have to be converted to
DER encoding first, e.g. using the `*openssl*` command

 $ openssl x509 -in carolCert.pem -inform PEM -out carolCert.der -outform DER

As mentioned above the URL is just the base URL plus the SHA1 hash of the
certificate data. To compute the hash, either `*openssl*`
----
$ openssl dgst -sha1 carolCert.der
SHA1(carolCert.der)= 2979610b950df52476a7b0f1cd2baa2bf8026d77
----
or `*sha1sum*`
----
$ sha1sum carolCert.der
2979610b950df52476a7b0f1cd2baa2bf8026d77  carolCert.der
----
can be used. The file `*carolCert.der*` is now renamed to
`*2979610b950df52476a7b0f1cd2baa2bf8026d77*` and uploaded to the web server
`*winnetou*`.

== Hash and URL Use

In the example presented above `*carol*` sends her certificate in the form of a
{RFC7296}#section-3.6[*Hash and URL*] and `*moon*` fetches the actual certificate
from `*winnetou*`
----
received cert request for "C=CH, O=strongSwan Project, CN=strongSwan Root CA"
received hash-and-url for end entity cert "http://winnetou.strongswan.org/certs/2979610b950df52476a7b0f1cd2baa2bf8026d77"
fetching certificate from 'http://winnetou.strongswan.org/certs/2979610b950df52476a7b0f1cd2baa2bf8026d77' ...
fetched certificate "C=CH, O=strongSwan Project, OU=Research, CN=carol@strongswan.org"
----

== Multi-Level CA Example

{RFC7296}#section-3.6[*Hash and URL*] also works in a multi-level CA setup where
intermediate CA certificates are used.
