Generally IPsec processing is based on policies. After regular route lookups are
done the OS kernel consults its SPD (Security Policy Database) for a matching
policy and if one is found that is associated with an IPsec SA (Security
Association) the packet is processed (e.g. encrypted and sent as ESP packet).

Depending on the operating system it is also possible to configure route-based
VPNs. Here IPsec processing does not (only) depend on negotiated policies but may
e.g. be controlled by routing packets to a specific interface.

Most of these approaches also allow an easy capture of plaintext traffic, which
depending on the operating system might not be that straight-forward with
policy-based VPNs, see xref:install/trafficDumps.adoc[Traffic Dumps].
Another advantage this approach could have is that the MTU can be specified for
the tunneling devices, allowing to fragment packets before tunneling them, in case
PMTU discovery does not work properly.

== VTI Devices on Linux

NOTE: VTI devices are supported since the Linux 3.6 kernel but some important
      changes were added later (3.15+). The information below might not be accurate
      for older kernel versions. On newer kernels (4.19+), XFRM interfaces provide
      a better solution than VTI devices, see xref:#_xfrm_interfaces_on_linux[below]
      for details.

VTI devices act like a wrapper around existing IPsec policies. This means you can't
just route arbitrary packets to a VTI device to get them tunneled, the established
IPsec policies have to match, too. However, you can negotiate `*0.0.0.0/0*` traffic
selectors on both ends to allow tunneling any traffic that is routed via the VTI
device.

To make this work, i.e. to prevent packets not routed via the VTI device from matching
the policies (if `*0.0.0.0/0*` is used every packet would match), *marks* are used.
Only packets that are marked accordingly will match the policies and get tunneled.
For other packets the policies are ignored. Whenever a packet is routed to a VTI
device it automatically gets the configured mark applied, so it will match the
policy and get tunneled.

It's important to note that VTI tunnel devices are a local feature, no additional
encapsulation (like with GRE, see xref:#_gre_tunnels[below]) is added, so the other
end does not have to be aware that VTI devices are used in addition to regular IPsec
policies.

=== VTI Device Management

A VTI device may be created with the following command:

 ip tunnel add <name> local <local IP> remote <remote IP> mode vti key <mark>

`<name>` can be any valid device name (e.g. `*ipsec0*`, `*vti0*` etc.). But note
that the `*ip*` command treats names starting with `*vti*` special in some instances
(e.g. when retrieving device statistics). The IP addresses are the endpoints of the
IPsec tunnel. `<mark>` has to match the mark configured for the connection. It is
also possible to configure different marks for in- and outbound traffic using
`*ikey* <mark>` and `*okey* <mark>`, but that is usually not required.

After creating the device, it has to be enabled (`*ip link set* <name> *up*`) and
then routes may be installed (routing protocols may also be used).  To avoid
duplicate policy lookups it is also recommended to set

 sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.<name>.disable_policy=1

All of this also works for IPv6.

==== Example: Creation of two VTI Devices (vti0 and ipsec0)
----
ip tunnel add vti0   local 192.168.0.1 remote 192.168.0.2 mode vti key 42
ip tunnel add ipsec0 local 192.168.0.1 remote 192.168.0.2 mode vti key 0x01000201
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.vti0.disable_policy=1
ip link set vti0 up
ip route add 10.1.0.0/16 dev vti0
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.ipsec0.disable_policy=1
ip link set ipsec0 up
ip route add 10.2.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
ip route add 10.3.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
----
Statistics on VTI devices may be displayed with

 ip -s tunnel show [<name>]

Note that specifying a name will not show any statistics if the device name starts
with `*vti*`.

A VTI device may be removed again with

 ip tunnel del <name>

=== Configuration

First the route installation by the IKE daemon must be disabled. To do this, set
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

 charon.install_routes = 0

Then configure a regular site-to-site connection, either with the traffic selectors
set to `*0.0.0.0/0*` on both ends
----
local_ts  = 0.0.0.0/0
remote_ts = 0.0.0.0/0
----
in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] or set to specific subnets. As
mentioned above, only traffic that matches these traffic selectors will then
actually be forwarded. Other packets routed to the VTI device will be rejected with
an ICMP error message (`destination unreachable/destination host unreachable`).

The most important configuration optiona are `*mark_in*` and `*mark_out*` in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]. After applying the optional mask
(default is `*0xffffffff*`) to the mark that's set on the VTI device and it applied
to the routed packets, the value has to match the configured mark.

Referring to the example above, to match the mark on `*vti0*`, configure
`*mark_in`* = `*mark_out*` = `*42*` and to match the mark on `*ipsec0*`, set the
value to `*0x01000201*` (but something like `*0x00000200/0x00000f00*` would also
work).

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXVTI}[example] showing the use of VTI devices
image::a-m-w-s-b.png[topology,501,190,link={EXVTI}]

=== Sharing VTI Devices

VTI devices may be shared by multiple IPsec SAs (e.g. in roadwarrior scenarios,
to capture traffic or lower the MTU) by setting the remote endpoint of the VTI
device to `*0.0.0.0`*. For instance:

 ip tunnel add ipsec0 local 192.168.0.1 remote 0.0.0.0 mode vti key 42

Then assuming xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP] addresses for roadwarriors are
assigned from the `*10.0.1.0/24*` subnet a matching route may be installed with

 ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 dev ipsec0

NOTE: Only one such device with the same local IP may be created.

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXSHVTI}[example] showing the use of shared VTI devices
image::a-m-c-w-d.png[topology,372,190,link={EXSHVTI}]

=== Connection-specific VTI Devices

With a custom xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*updown*`] script it is also possible to
set up connection-specific VTI devices. For instance, to create a VTI device on a
roadwarrrior client that receives a dynamic xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP]
address (courtesy of Endre Szab√≥):

==== Example Script for Roadwarriors
----
#!/bin/bash

# set charon.install_virtual_ip = no to prevent the daemon from also installing the VIP

set -o nounset
set -o errexit

VTI_IF="vti${PLUTO_UNIQUEID}"

case "${PLUTO_VERB}" in
    up-client)
        ip tunnel add "${VTI_IF}" local "${PLUTO_ME}" remote "${PLUTO_PEER}" mode vti \
            key "${PLUTO_MARK_OUT%%/*}"
        ip link set "${VTI_IF}" up
        ip addr add "${PLUTO_MY_SOURCEIP}" dev "${VTI_IF}"
        ip route add "${PLUTO_PEER_CLIENT}" dev "${VTI_IF}"
        sysctl -w "net.ipv4.conf.${VTI_IF}.disable_policy=1"
        ;;
    down-client)
        ip tunnel del "${VTI_IF}"
        ;;
esac
----
If there is more than one subnet in the remote traffic selector this might cause
conflicts as the xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*updown*`] script will be called for
each combination of local and remote subnet.

Dynamically creating such devices on the server could be problematic if two
roadwarriors are connected from the same IP. The kernel rejects the creation of
a VTI device if the remote and local addresses are already in use by another VTI
device.

In the following script, it is assumed that only the roadwarrior's assigned IPv4
IP is supposed to be reachable over the assigned tunnel.

==== Example Script for Gateways
----
#!/bin/bash

# set charon.install_virtual_ip = no to prevent the daemon from also installing the VIP

set -o nounset
set -o errexit

VTI_IF="vti${PLUTO_UNIQUEID}"

case "${PLUTO_VERB}" in
    up-client)
        ip tunnel add "${VTI_IF}" local "${PLUTO_ME}" remote "${PLUTO_PEER}" mode vti \
            key "${PLUTO_MARK_OUT%%/*}"
        ip link set "${VTI_IF}" up
        ip route add "${PLUTO_PEER_SOURCEIP}" dev "${VTI_IF}"
        sysctl -w "net.ipv4.conf.${VTI_IF}.disable_policy=1"
        ;;
    down-client)
        ip tunnel del "${VTI_IF}"
        ;;
esac
----

NOTE: Using *PLUTO_UNIQUEID* might not be a good idea if IKE_SAs may be rekeyed,
      as the unique ID will change with each rekeying (i.e. the script won't be
      able to delete the device anymore). Using some other identifier (e.g. parts
      of the virtual IP or the mark if it is unique) might be better.

== XFRM Interfaces on Linux

NOTE: strongSwan supports XFRM interfaces since version 5.8.0. They are supported
      by the Linux kernel since 4.19 and *iproute2* version 5.1.0+.

XFRM interfaces are similar to VTI devices in their basic functionality (see
xref:#_vti_devices_on_linux[above] for details) but offer several advantages:

* No tunnel endpoint addresses have to be configured on the interfaces. Compared
  to VTIs, which are layer 3 tunnel devices with mandatory endpoints, this resolves
  issues with wildcard addresses (only one VTI with wildcard endpoints is supported),
  avoids a 1:1 mapping between SAs and interfaces and easily allows SAs with multiple
  peers to share the same interface.

* Because there are no endpoint addresses, IPv4 and IPv6 SAs are supported on the
  same interface (VTI devices only support one address family).

* IPsec modes other than tunnel are supported (VTI devices only support tunnel
  mode).

* No awkward configuration via GRE keys and XFRM marks. Instead, a new identifier
 (XFRM interface ID) links policies and SAs with XFRM interfaces.

As mentioned above, the policies and SAs are linked to XFRM interface via a new
identifier (interface ID). Like XFRM marks they are part of the policy selector.
That is, policies will only match traffic if it was routed via an XFRM interface
with a matching interface ID and duplicate policies are allowed as long as the
interface ID is different. So as with VTI devices it's possible to negotiate
`*0.0.0.0/0*` as traffic selector on both ends (to tunnel arbitrary traffic) for
multiple CHILD_SAs as long as the interface IDs are different.

Traffic that's routed to an XFRM interface, while no policies and SAs with matching
interface ID exist, will be dropped by the kernel. Likewise, as long as no interface
with a matching interface ID exists, the policies and SAs will not be operational
(i.e. outbound traffic bypasses the policies and inbound traffic is dropped). So
it's possible to create interfaces before SAs are created or afterwards (e.g. via
xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] events or xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*updown*`]
scripts which both receive configured or optionally dynamically generated interface
IDs).

Using trap policies to dynamically create IPsec SAs based on matching traffic that
has been routed to an XFRM interface is also an option.

It's possible to use separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic, which is
why interface IDs may be configured for in- and outbound policies/SAs separately
(see below).

=== XFRM Interface Management

With `*iproute2*` 5.1.0 and newer an XFRM interface can be created as such:

 ip link add <name> type xfrm dev <underlying interface> if_id <interface ID>

strongSwan also comes with a utility (called `*xfrmi*`) to create XFRM interfaces
if `*iproute2*` can not create the interface.

 /usr/local/libexec/ipsec/xfrmi --name <name> --id <interface ID> --dev <underlying interface>

`<name>` can be any valid device name (e.g. `*ipsec0*`, `*xfrm0*`, etc.).
`<interface ID>` is a decimal or hex (`*0x*` prefix) 32-bit number. The underlying
interface currently is mandatory, but doesn't really matter (it only does if an
interface is configured on the outbound policy - and it might with hardware IPsec
offloading, but that has not been tested by us), so it could be anything, even `*lo*`.

The interface can afterwards be managed via `*iproute2*`. So to activate it, use

 ip link set <name> up

Addresses, if necessary, can be added with `*ip addr*` and the interface may
eventually be deleted with

 ip link del <name>

==== Example: Create XFRM Interface (ipsec0)
----
ip link add ipsec0 type xfrm dev eth0 if_id 42
# or if not supported by iproute2 yet:
/usr/local/libexec/ipsec/xfrmi --name ipsec0 --id 42 --dev eth0

ip link set ipsec0 up
ip route add 10.1.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
ip route add 10.2.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
----
Statistics are available via

 ip -s link show [<name>]

The `*xfrmi*` command provides a `*--list*` option to list existing XFRM interfaces
if using older versions of `*iproute2*` does not list the interface ID of XFRM
interfaces yet with `*ip -d link*`.

=== Configuration

IMPORTANT: The daemon will not install any routes for CHILD_SAs with outbound
           interface ID, so it's not necessary to disable the route installation
           globally.

Keep in mind that traffic routed to XFRM interfaces has to match the negotiated
IPsec policies. Therefore, connections are configured as they would if no interfaces
were to be used. However, since policies won't affect traffic that's not routed
via XFRM interfaces, it's possible to negotiate `*0.0.0.0/0*` or `*::/0*` as traffic
selector on both ends to tunnel arbitrary traffic.

The most important connection configuration option in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] is the interface ID `*if_id_in*`
and `*if_id_out*`. To use a single interface for in- and outbound traffic set them
to the same value (or `*%unique*` to generate a unique ID for each CHILD_SA).
To use separate interfaces for each direction, configure distinct values (or
`*%unique-dir*` to generate unique IDs for each CHILD_SA and direction). It's also
possible to use an XFRM interface only in one direction by setting only one of the
two settings.

When setting the options on the connection-level, all CHILD_SAs for which the
settings are not set will inherit the interface IDs of the IKE_SA (use `*%unique*`
or `*%unique-dir*` to allocate unique IDs for each IKE_SA/direction that are
inherited by all CHILD_SAs created under the IKE_SA).

It's possible to use transport mode for host-to-host connections between two peers.

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXXFRM}[example] showing the use of XFRM interfaces
image::a-m-w-s-b.png[topology,501,190,link={EXXFRM}]

=== Sharing XFRM Interfaces

Because no endpoint addresses are configured on the interfaces they can easily be
shared by multiple SAs as long as the policies don't conflict. Just configure the
same interface ID for the CHILD_SAs (this also works automatically for roadwarrior
connections where each client gets an individual IP address assigned - just route
the subnets used for virtual IPs to the XFRM interface).

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXSHXFRM}[example] showing the use of shared XFRM interfaces
image::a-m-c-w-d.png[topology,372,190,link={EXSHXFRM}]

=== Connection-specific XFRM Interfaces

Using custom xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] or xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*updown*`]
scripts allows creating connection-specific XFRM interfaces. The interface ID
(in particular if `*%unique[-dir]*` is used) is available in the scripts to create
the XFRM interface dynamically.

Note that xref:plugins/updown.adoc[`*updown*`] scripts are called for each
combination of of local and remote subnet, so this might cause conflicts if more
than one subnet is negotiated in the traffic selectors (i.e. this requires some
kind of refcounting). The `*child-updown*` xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] event,
however is only triggered once per CHILD_SA. To create connection-level XFRM
interfaces with dynamic interface IDs, use the `*ike-updown*`
xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] event.

=== Network Namespaces

XFRM interfaces can be moved to network namespaces to provide the processes there
access to IPsec SAs/policies that were created in a different network namespace.
For instance, this allows a single IKE daemon to provide IPsec connections for
processes in different network namespaces (or full containers) without them having
access to the keys of the SAs (the SAs won't be visible in the other network
namespaces, only the XFRM interface).

=== XFRM interfaces in VRFs

XFRM interfaces can be associated to a VRF layer 3 master device, so any tunnel
terminated by an XFRM interface implicitly is bound to that VRF domain. For example,
this allows multi-tenancy setups where traffic from different tunnels can be
separated and routed over different interfaces.

Due to a limitation in XFRM interfaces, inbound traffic fails policy checking in
kernels prior to version 5.1.

=== Netfilter IPsec Policy Match with XFRM Interfaces

Due to a limitation in the Netfilter IPsec `*policy*` match, output traffic
forwarded over an XFRM interface does not match (inbound it matches, though).
`*policy*` matching is not really required anymore when using XFRM interfaces, as
the Netfilter rules can just match on the interface. So the work-around is to
filter just on XFRM interface names instead of IPsec `*policy*` matches.

== Marks on Linux

One of the core features of VTI devices or XFRM interfaces, dynamically specifying
which traffic to tunnel can actually be replicated directly with marks and firewall
rules. By configuring connections with marks and then selectively marking packets
directly with Netfilter rules via `*MARK*` target in the `*PREROUTING*` or
`*FORWARD*` chains only specific traffic will get tunneled.

This may also be used to create multiple identical tunnels for which firewall rules
dynamically decide which traffic is tunneled through which IPsec SA.

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXMARK}[example] showing the use of marks for QoS/DiffServ
image::a-v-m-w-s-b.png[topology,501,190,link={EXMARK}]

== GRE Tunnels

Another alternative is to use GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) which is a
generic point-to-point tunneling protocol that adds an additional encapsulation
layer (at least 4 bytes).  But it provides a portable way of creating route-based
VPNs (running a routing protocol on-top is also easy).

While VTI devices depend on site-to-site IPsec connections in tunnel mode (XFRM
interfaces are more flexible), GRE uses a host-to-host connection that can also be
run in transport mode (avoiding additional overhead). But while VTI devices and
XFRM interfaces may be used by only one of the peers, GRE must be used by both of
them.

=== GRE Tunnel Management

Creating a GRE tunnel on Linux can be done as follows:

 ip tunnel add <name> local <local IP> remote <remote IP> mode gre

`<name>` can be any valid interface name (e.g. `*ipsec0*`, `*gre0*`, etc.). But
note that the `*ip*` command treats names starting with `*gre*` special in some
instances (e.g. when retrieving device statistics). The IPs are the endpoints of
the IPsec tunnel.

After creating the interface it has to be enabled with

 ip link set <name> up

and then routes may be installed.

==== Example: Creation of GRE Tunnel (ipsec0)
----
ip tunnel add ipsec0 local 192.168.0.1 remote 192.168.0.2 mode gre
ip link set ipsec0 up
ip route add 10.1.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
ip route add 10.2.0.0/16 dev ipsec0
----

Statistics on GRE devices may be displayed with

 ip -s tunnel show [<name>]

Note that specifying a name will not show any statistics if the device name starts
with `*gre*`.

A GRE device may be removed again with

 ip tunnel del <name>

=== Configuration

As mentioned above, a host-to-host IPsec connection in transport mode can be used.
The traffic selectors may even be limited to just the GRE protocol
(`*local_ts|remote_ts = dynamic[gre]*` in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`].

=== Example

.strongSwan {EXGRE}[example] showing the use of GRE tunnels
image::a-m-w-s-b.png[topology,501,190,link={EXGRE}]

=== Automation

Setting up and configuration of GRE tunnels can be automated using `*systemd*`
units (templates) and a custom updown script to set the correct IP address for
remote peers using GRE tunnels.

The following files outline fully functional examples for implementing that:

== libipsec and TUN Devices

Based on our own userland IPsec implementation and the
xref:plugins/kernel-libipsec.adoc[`*kernel-libipsec*`] plugin it is possible to
create route-based VPNs with TUN devices. Similar to VTI devices or XFRM interfaces
the negotiated IPsec policies have to match the traffic routed via TUN device.
In particular because packets have to be copied between kernel and userland it is
not as efficient as the solutions above (also read the notes on
xref:plugins/kernel-libipsec.adoc[`*kernel-libipsec*`]).

== Problems

Make sure to disable the xref:plugins/connmark.adoc[`*connmark*`] plugin when running
a VTI interface. Otherwise, it will insert Netfilter rules into the `*mangle*` table
that prevent the VTI from working.
