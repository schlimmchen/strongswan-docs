== General Questions

=== Capturing outbound plaintext packets with tcpdump/wireshark

*Q:* _When using `tcpdump/wireshark` to sniff traffic secured by IPsec,
incoming packets show up twice: encrypted i.e. as ESP packets and unencrypted as
plaintext packets. However, for outgoing traffic, only ESP packets show up. How
can I get incoming *and* outgoing packets as plaintext?_

*A:* That's a peculiarity of the Linux kernel. Capture the (UDP encapsulated) ESP
packets and use wireshark to decrypt them. See https://wiki.wireshark.org/ESP_Preferences

Run the `*ip xfrm state*` command to determine the encryption algorithms and the
symmetric keys used by the kernel. Depending on your configuration, strongSwan
periodically changes encryption keys. Keep this in mind if you are capturing
traffic over an extended period of time.

There's also a document that shows different ways to
xref:install/trafficDumps.adoc[dump traffic] on the IPsec endpoint.

=== Non-standard IKE ports

*Q:* _Can I use a local non-standard port for IKE?_

*A:* The default socket implementation `*socket-default*` can only listen on two
predetermined ports. By default one is used for xref:features/natTraversal.adoc[].
There are compile time options and two settings in
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] to determine these ports,
but clients usually will only use the default ports (`*500/4500*`). To use
ephemeral source ports on a client, these settings may be set to `*0*` so the
plugin determines them when it's initialized.

As a client, strongSwan can use an arbitrary remote port, which may be configured
via `*remote_port*` in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] (see the
notes regarding
xref:features/natTraversal.adoc#_custom_server_ports[custom server ports and NAT-Traversal]).
There is also another socket implementation called `*socket-dynamic*`, which is
experimental and can send IKE messages from specific source ports (specified with
`*local_port*`), and requires sending packets to the remote NAT-T port (e.g.
`*remote_port = 4500*`).

You can also use the `DNAT` and `SNAT` targets in `*iptables*` to move ports around,
if you desire so.

=== Plugin is missing

*Q:* _I need some xref:plugins/plugins.adoc[plugin], but it seems my version
of charon doesn't load it! What should I do?!_

*A:* Check if you xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc[customized the list of loaded plugins].
If so, make sure the plugin you need is included (see below for details on modular
plugin loading). Then make sure the plugin is actually installed. For that, run
`*find*` (check the man page of `*find*` for the syntax) with the required parameters
to search your hard drive for the plugin's `*.so*` file. If it exists and is in a
plausible directory, then it should be installed. Then restart the daemon.

If your installation of strongSwan is configured for
xref:plugins/pluginLoad.adoc#_modular_configuration[modular loading]
(the default since version 5.1.2) and
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] includes the
`*strongswan.d/charon/*` directory, check if the plugin-specific configuration
file in that directory contains `*load = yes*` in the plugin-specific configuration
section. If the file doesn't exist, the plugin is likely not installed.

If you compiled strongSwan yourself, rebuild it with the required plugins
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[enabled]. Make sure to run `*make clean*` before rebuilding
again to update the plugin lists used by the executables.

If you got strongSwan from the xref:install/install.adoc[repositories of a distribution],
look for additional packages. It is likely the distribution ships the plugin you're
looking for in another package. If you still can not find it, search the issue tracker
of that distribution for a bug report or feature request for the plugin you want.
If you found one, weigh in on it, unless it is already closed or a plausible
reason was given why the request can not be fulfilled.
If you did not find a bug report or feature request in the issue tracker of that
distribution, open one stating your request for the plugin you're looking for to
be included.

=== strongSwan crashes

*Q:* _strongSwan crashes and I don't know why. What should I do?_

*A:* If you are not using the latest version, it is very likely that the crash
you experienced was already fixed.

If you xref:install/install.adoc[compiled it yourself], make sure your cleaned
the build directory before compiling. If you do not do that, you can end up linking
objects of different strongSwan versions together and that can cause crashes.
If you don't use the same configure options when building a newer version,
uninstalling/removing the previous binaries/libraries is required (the same applies
if you previously had strongSwan installed from a distribution package).
Then recompile it and reinstall it.

If you installed it as xref:install/install.adoc[binary package], check the
corresponding distribution's issue tracker for reports.

In either case, if the crashes persist, try to find a similar report in our
issue tracker or discussion forum and read it. If you can't find one, create
a new one with as much details as possible.

=== Configuration compatibility with FreeS/WAN, Openswan and Libreswan

*Q:* _Are configuration files of FreeS/WAN, Openswan and Libreswan compatible with the ones of strongSwan?_

*A:* They are not compatible. Although the general format of `*ipsec.conf*` is
identical between the different swans, the files are not compatible, because several
options have different meanings and a variety of different options are absent from
some versions and others exist. Do not attempt to reuse configuration files between
different swans.

NOTE: The *ipsec.conf* backend is deprecated, use
      xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] or
      xref:plugins/vici.adoc[`*vici*`] instead.

=== Multiple subnets per SA

*Q:* _Can I tunnel several subnets in one CHILD_SA?_

*A:* If you use IKEv2, you can if the peers support it. Some do not (e.g. devices
by Checkpoint, Cisco and Fortinet, refer to the *Interoperability* section for details).
If you use IKEv1, you need to be a roadwarrior and use the _UNITY_ extension.
strongSwan implements it with the xref:plugins/unity.adoc[`*unity*`] plugin.

In any other case, you need to define a separate CHILD_SA per subnet pair.

=== IPsec and iptables/nftables

*Q:* _How does IPsec on Linux interact with `iptables/nftables`?_

*A:* IPsec-protected traffic passes through the same tables and chains as
unprotected traffic. The only exception is that IPsec-protected traffic passes
through some chains twice. You can tell protected and unprotected traffic apart
using the `*policy*` module in `*iptables*` or the `*nft_xfrm*` module in `*nftables*`.
The {NETFILTER}[Netfilter traffic flow graph] shows where IPsec (XFRM) hooks into
Netfilter and which tables and chains are traversed in what order.

Packets that are compressed using xref:features/ipcomp.adoc[IPComp] pass through
some chains three times. Once as encapsulated packet, then as IP-in-IP packet and
then as the actual packet. The protocol number depends on the encapsulated protocol.
You need to allow the protocols in the firewall depending on your tunnel configuration.

=== IPsec policy ordering

*Q:* _In which order do IPsec policies apply?_

*Q:* The policies' priorities are used to order them. They are checked from the
lowest priority to the highest priority. The one that matches first is applied
(first match wins, lower number = higher priority).

strongSwan installs all passthrough policies with higher priorities than other
policies and drop policies with lower priorities.  The priorities can be changed
manually via `*<child>.priority*` setting in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`].

=== High Availability and Failover configurations

*Q:* _Does strongSwan support high availability and failover configurations?_

*A:* At this moment (version 5.9.6), strongSwan only supports
xref:features/highAvailability.adoc[active-active/passive HA clusters] that are
comprised of two nodes. It only supports such configurations when both peers
receive the same packets by use of an multicast group, as described on
xref:features/highAvailability.adoc[].

Failover configurations with policy-based tunnels are, while not impossible, tricky
to implement. However, with xref:features/routeBasedVpn.adoc[route-based tunnels]
that are built using virtual interfaces and with a dynamic routing daemon, such
a configuration should be easily possible between one strongSwan installation
and two redundant remote gateways, like AWS.

=== No matching peer config found

*Q:* _The connection attempt by a peer fails with the error `no matching peer config found`.
How do I fix this?_

*A:* When a peer connects, the IKE daemon has to find a config object with all the
information required for the authentication of the peer and the CHILD_SAs that
should be established. It does this by comparing the *IP addresses* and the
*identities* in the received message to those in the loaded configurations (the
IKE proposal is also considered in newer versions). If no matching configuration
is found based on that information, the connection can't be established and you
see the corresponding error message.

That message is actually preceded by another that looks something like this:

----
looking for peer configs matching 192.168.0.1[moon.strongswan.org]...192.168.0.100[carol@strongswan.org]
----

which contains the following information:

192.168.0.1:: Local IP address of the IKE_SA (= responder/server's IP)
[moon.strongswan.org]:: Responder/Server identity proposed by the
initiator/client in the IDr payload, if one was received, must match the local
identity that's configured
192.168.0.100:: Remote IP address of the IKE_SA (= initiator/client's IP)
[\carol@strongswan.org]:: Initiator/Client identity proposed by the
initiator/client in the IDi payload, must match the remote identity that's
configured

Basically, this information has to match whatever is configured in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] (wildcards are allowed in the
configured identities, e.g. `*&ast;@strongswan.org*`). So if no config is found,
make sure to compare the data in the log message to the configured values seen
in xref:swanctl/swanctlListConns.adoc[`*swanctl --list-conns*`].

Note that the type of compared identities (e.g. FQDN vs. USER_FQDN or KEY_ID,
see xref:config/identityParsing.adoc[identity parsing]) must match too. Identities
might look the same in the log and e.g.
xref:swanctl/swanctlListConns.adoc[`*swanctl --list-conns*`] but their type could
be different. More details about this comparison (including the type) are logged
only if the xref:config/logging.adoc[log level] for `*cfg*` is increased to `*3*`.

=== Constraint check failed: identity '...' required

*Q:* _The authentication fails with the error `constraint check failed: identity '...' required`.
What exactly is the problem?_

*A:* To prevent {MITM}[MITM attacks], some of the clients that, for simplicity, don't
require configuring the server identity explicitly (e.g. the
xref:os/android.adoc[Android app] or the
xref:features/networkManager.adoc[NetworkManager plugin]) enforce the hostname/IP
as remote identity and will check that this identity is contained in a
`*subjectAlternativeName*` (SAN) extension of the server certificate. If that's not
the case, you'll receive that error (also see the questions below regarding
matching identities against CN and wildcard certificates). Both mentioned clients
allow configuring the server identity explicitly in the advanced settings, but
other clients might not. In that case you'll have to add the missing SAN to the
certificate (e.g. with the `*--san*` option for
xref:pki/pkiIssue.adoc[`*pki --issue*`]) or use a hostname or IP address that's
already contained as SAN in the certificate.

=== Pre-Shared Key Authentication

*Q:* _Should I use IKE with PSK authentication?_

*A:* Both IKEv1 and IKEv2 with PSK-based authentication are vulnerable to dictionary
and brute-force attacks (online but also offline if a password hash was actively
gathered beforehand, with <<Aggressive Mode, IKEv1 Aggressive Mode>> even passively).
So it is generally recommended to use digital signature (certificate) based authentication.

If you have to use PSKs, you should generate high entropy PSKs as shown in the
xref:howtos/securityRecommendations.adoc#_preshared_keys[security recommendations].
It's also not recommended to use the same PSK for multiple hosts, e.g. to authenticate
a server in roadwarrior scenarios (every client that knows the PSK can impersonate
the server or any of the other clients).

For roadwarrior scenarios with IKEv2, username/password-based EAP authentication
for clients with certificate authentication for the server might be an option.
The certificate makes sure clients only send their password hash to the correct
server (which prevents offline attacks). However, such setups could still be
vulnerable to online attacks if weak user passwords are used.

== Certificates / Private Keys

=== Wildcard Certificates

*Q:* _Does strongSwan support wildcard certificates?_

*A:* No, it doesn't. The reason for that is that wildcard certificates were declared
{RFC6125}#section-7.2[deprecated in RFC 6125].

=== Matching CN field in Distinguished Names

*Q:* _Does strongSwan support checking a FQDN identity against the Common Name (CN)
field of a Distinguished Name (DN) in X.509 certificates?_

*A:* No, it doesn't. Distinguished Names of certificates (and with that any RDNs,
such as CN) are only matched against identities of type `*DN*`. For instance, the
identity `*vpn.strongswan.org*` won't match a certificate's subject DN such as
`*C=CH, O=strongSwan, CN=vpn.strongswan.org*`. However, the `*DN*` identity
`*C=&ast;, O=&ast;, CN=vpn.strongswan.org*` would match it (also see
`*charon.rdn_matching*` in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]).

To match an identity of type `*FQDN*` (fully qualified domain name) or
`*USER_FQDN*` (email address) against a certificate, it has to be present in
a subjectAltName (SAN) extension of the correct type.  In the above example
`*vpn.strongswan.org*` would have to be contained in a SAN of type `*dNSName*`.

=== X.509 Certificate Chain Files

*Q:* _Can strongSwan read chain files (an end-entity certificate and the CAs that are required to authenticate it)?_

*A:* Not completely, it only reads the first certificate from such files.

=== No private key found

*Q:* _strongSwan logs "no private key found". What's wrong?_

*A:* You are trying to use a certificate to authenticate yourself for which you
did not provide the private key to strongSwan. Check the log for errors when
the private keys are loaded.

If it persists, check that the certificate's public key was generated using the
private key you're trying to use (e.g. with xref:pki/pkiPrint.adoc[`*pki --print*`]
and xref:pki/pkiVerify.adoc[`*pki --verify*`]). It surprisingly often happens that
people re-generate keys and certificates and try to use the wrong private key.

=== No trusted RSA public key found for [...]

*Q:* _I get the error `no trusted RSA public key found for [...]` when trying to establish my VPN connection. Why is that happening?_

*A:* The daemon is unable to authenticate the remote peer's transmitted identity
using its available authentication credentials (e.g. transmitted client certificate,
all transmitted and installed/trusted CA certificates).

Make sure your configuration fulfills the following requirements:

 * The end-entity certificate is transmitted (check the log for `sending end entity
cert` and/or `received end entity cert`) or locally installed (make sure it matches
the peer's private key)
+
This is affected by the `*send_certreq*` and `*send_cert*` settings in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`].

 * Any required intermediate CA certificates are also sent or locally installed

 * The root/intermediate CA that issued the end-entity certificate is trusted or
   the end-entity certificate is locally installed (check
   xref:swanctl/swanctlListCerts.adoc[`*swanctl --list-certs*`])

 * The end-entity and CA certificates are valid (make sure to also check the system
   time). Note that this check is skipped for locally installed end-entity certificates

 * The transmitted identity is either in one of it's certificate's SAN fields
   with the correct type (type IP if it's an IP, type FQDN if it's a FQDN) or it
   equals the certificate's full subject DN (distinguished name)

== IKEv2

=== Disabling NAT traversal?

*Q:* _How can I turn off NAT traversal in charon (IKEv2)?_

*A:* NAT traversal cannot be disabled in the charon daemon. If you don't like
automatic port floating to UDP/4500 due to the MOBIKE protocol ({RFC4555}[RFC 4555]),
which happens even if no NAT situation exists, then you can disable MOBIKE by
disabling `*<conn>.mobike*` in xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`].

=== Public Key Authentication Fails With Retransmissions

*Q:* _My IKEv2 connection fails with retransmits during the IKE_AUTH exchange
when using RSA certificates, but works when a PSK is used. Why?_

*A:* This is probably related to the Path MTU. The IKE_AUTH messages that contain
the certificates and certificate requests can get pretty big, therefore, the IP
packets transporting these UDP datagrams could get fragmented. Some firewalls
might block IP fragments and will therefore hamper your IKE connection.

strongSwan and many other implementations support {RFC7383}[IKEv2 fragmentation]
to avoid this problem. Make sure this is not disabled (`fragmentation` option in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]) and the peer supports it (check
for `FRAGMENTATION_SUPPORTED` (`FRAG_SUP`) notifies in IKE_SA_INIT messages in the
log).

If you can't use IKEv2 fragmentation or configure the responsible firewall(s) to
accept IP fragments, you could try to preload the certificates on both sides and
then configure `*send_cert=never*` in
xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] to prevent the daemon from sending
certificates (`*send_certreq=no*` may be used to avoid sending certificate requests,
which also prevents that certificates are sent with the default setting of
`*ifasked*` for `*send_cert*`).

Using ECDSA instead of RSA will also reduce the size of the IKE_AUTH messages as
keys/certificates will be significantly smaller.

== IKEv1

=== No proposal chosen returned by ZyXEL/Linksys/x router

*Q:* _I'm trying to set up a VPN tunnel with a ZyXEL/Linksys/X router but the
other side keeps on telling me `no proposal chosen` when strongSwan initiates the connection._

*A:* Make sure that the peer supports all the algorithms (including the key
lengths) which strongSwan proposes for IKE and ESP. In terms of IKE, the proposal
consists of the following parts: Encryption algorithm, hash algorithm (PRF) and
DH group. In terms of ESP, the proposal includes the following: Encryption algorithm,
hash algorithm, DH group (for PFS) and compression algorithm. There are lots of
IPsec implementations out there that do *not* support compression or have
implemented it erroneously. So the first thing to try in this situation is to
switch compression off (the default). Then try to make sure the proposals match
on both ends.

=== Invalid HASH_V1 payload length, decryption failed?

*Q:* _I'm getting the error message `invalid HASH_V1 payload length, decryption failed?`
when using PSK authentication. What could be the reason?_

*A:* This is most likely due to an incorrect PSK on one of the peers. Since the
PSK is incorporated into the key material used so secure the IKEv1 packets they
can't be decrypted properly if the PSKs don't match.

Note that the PSK whose associated identities/IPs matches best is used. So if the
local identity is configured with every PSK, every PSK will basically match to
some degree. Which is why only remote identities/IPs should be associated with PSKs.

For IKEv1, there is also a lookup based on the IP addresses (i.e. every secret
that lists the local IP will match). And as responder, identities can only be
used directly to find PSKs if aggressive mode is used (<<Aggressive Mode, which
should never be used with PSK>>). However, if a configuration is found (based on
the IPs) a lookup based on the configured identities is still done (all matching
configs are considered until a PSK is found).

=== Aggressive Mode

*Q:* _Does strongSwan support IKEv1 Aggressive Mode?_

*A:* Since version 5.0.0 the answer is _yes_. However, the strongSwan developers
still recommend to avoid its use with pre-shared keys. This is due to a known
weakness of the protocol. With Aggressive Mode, a hash of the pre-shared key is
transmitted in clear-text. An eavesdropper can capture this hash and run an offline
brute-force attack against it. Once the pre-shared key is known {MITM}[MITM attacks]
to gather the XAuth credentials can easily be executed. Aggressive Mode is
therefore incompatible with the basic principles of the strongSwan project which
is to deliver a product that meets high security standards. That's why, in order
to use Aggressive Mode with pre-shared keys as responder (i.e. on gateways) it
is required to enable
----
charon {
  i_dont_care_about_security_and_use_aggressive_mode_psk = yes
}
----
in xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]. As promised often in
numerous public and private talks, strongSwan then changes its name to *weakSwan*.
It is not required to set this option for clients as they often have no other choice.

To avoid Aggressive Mode with pre-shared keys (and other short-comings of IKEv1
Main or Aggressive Mode) the best option is to switch to *IKEv2 with signature-based
authentication*, because IKEv2 PSK based authentication is also vulnerable to
dictionary and brute-force attacks.

But even for IKEv1 {TESTS}/ikev1/xauth-id-rsa-hybrid[hybrid authentication]
provides an easy to deploy alternative.  This mode uses a certificate to
authenticate the gateway and only XAuth to authenticate the client, during
Phase 1 (Main or Aggressive Mode) the client is not authenticated.

=== NAT Between Windows L2TP/IPsec Clients and strongSwan

*Q:* _I want to set up strongSwan to interoperate with Microsoft Windows using
L2TP/IPsec._

*A:* NAT-Traversal with IPsec transport mode has some inherent issues (see
{RFC3948}#section-5.2[RFC 3948] and
{TESTS}/ikev2/host2host-transport-nat[this test scenario]
for an illustration). While strongSwan supports NAT-T with transport mode, the
fundamental issues remain. Refer to the xref:plugins/connmark.adoc[`*connmark*`]
plugin for possible workarounds in some scenarios. However, for Windows L2TP clients
that all use the same client port
xref:plugins/connmark.adoc#_windows_l2tp[the plugin alone is not enough].
