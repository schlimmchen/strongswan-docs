= addrblock Plugin

:TESTS:   https://www.strongswan.org/testing/testresults6
:EX:      {TESTS}/ikev2/net2net-rfc3779
:RFC3779: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3779

== Purpose

The `*addrblock*` plugin for `*libcharon*` implements authorization of the
remote subnets against the `*IPAddrBlocks*` extension as standardized in
{RFC3779}[RFC 3779] that are contained in the peer's X.509 certificate.

If necessary and possible, the remote subnets proposed by the peer are
automatically narrowed to the subnets defined in the `*IPAddrBlocks*` extension.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-addrblock

== Behavior

The xref:pki/pki.adoc[pki] tool supports the issuing of both X.509 CA and
End-Entity certificates with address blocks using the argument

 --addrblock <address block>

`*10.1.0.0/16*` and `*192.168.0.1/32*` as well as the IPv6 addresses
`*fec0::1/128*` and `*fec1::/16*`.

----

In order for an End-Entity certificate to be valid, all the IP address blocks
defined in its `*IPAddrBlocks*` extension must be fully contained in the
IP address blocks as defined by the `*IPAddrBlocks*` extension of the issuing
CA's certificate:

* `*10.1.0.0/16*` contained in `*10.1.0.0..10.2.255.255*`: ok

* `*192.168.0.1/32*` contained in `*192.168.0.0/24*`: ok

* `*fec0::1/128*` contained in `*fec0::..fec2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff*`: ok

* `*fec1::/16*` contained in `*fec0::..fec2:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff*`: ok

== Configuration

The `*addrblock*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_addrblock[`*charon.plugins.addrblock*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

== Example

The VPN peer `*sun*` doesn't know the IPv4 subnet behind the VPN peer `*moon*`
nor its IPv4 host address:

----
connections {
   host {
      local {
         auth = pubkey
         certs = sunCert.pem
         id = sun.strongswan.org
      }
      remote {
         auth = pubkey
         id = moon.strongswan.org
      }
      children {
         net {
            local_ts  = 10.2.0.0/16
         }
      }
   }
}
----

Peer `*moon*` initiates an IPsec connection to peer `*sun*` and establishes both
a `*host*` `CHILD SA` as well as a `*net*` `CHILD SA`
----
15[IKE] checking certificate-based traffic selector constraints [RFC 3779]
15[IKE]   TS 192.168.0.1/32 is contained in address block constraint 192.168.0.1/32 (subset 192.168.0.1/32)
15[IKE] CHILD_SA host{1} established with SPIs c74e3018_i c6d3f865_o and TS 192.168.0.2/32 === 192.168.0.1/32
----
Because `*moon*` uses the IPv4 host address as defined in the certificate the
`*host*` CHILD SA` succeeds.
----
16[IKE] checking certificate-based traffic selector constraints [RFC 3779]
16[IKE]   TS 10.0.0.0/14 is contained in address block constraint 10.1.0.0/16 (subset 10.1.0.0/16)
16[IKE] CHILD_SA net{2} established with SPIs ca758282_i c83f2e49_o and TS 10.2.0.0/16 === 10.1.0.0/16
----
The peer proposes a much larger subnet `*10.0.0.0/14*` but it is automatically
narrowed by `*sun*` to the subnet `*10.1.0.0/16*` defined in the certificate.

In another connection attempt `*moon*` proposes a `*10.5.0.0/16*` network not
covered by the `*IPaddrBlock*` extension of the `*moon*` certificate
----
16[IKE] checking certificate-based traffic selector constraints [RFC 3779]
16[IKE]   TS 10.5.0.0/16 is not contained in any address block constraint
16[IKE] no acceptable traffic selectors found
16[IKE] failed to establish CHILD_SA, keeping IKE_SA
----
so the establishment of the `CHILD SA` fails.
