= Plugin List

The strongSwan distribution ships with an ever growing list of plugins. This
allows us to add extended and specialized features, but keep the core as small
as possible.

Many strongSwan component libraries come with a set of plugins. The plugins for
`*libstrongswan*` e.g. provide cryptographic backends, URI fetchers and database
layers whereas `*libcharon*` comes with a large set of very specialized plugins
for specific needs.
