= connmark Plugin

== Purpose

The `*connmark*` plugin for `*libcharon*` uses Linux Netfilter conntrack marks
on transport mode connections to separate flows between clients. As two transport
mode clients behind the same NAT use identical IPsec policies, some special
binding of upper layer protocols is required to return data over the correct SA.
While any client-initiated protocol supported by conntrack can be separated, the
main purpose is to differentiate multiple `L2TP` sessions. The plugin only works
for transport mode connections.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-connmark

Building the plugin requires `*iptables*` development headers to be installed.

== Configuration

The `*connmark*` plugin currently is used on any transport mode SA negotiated
that uses a unique mark. To configure such a connection as responder, use the
following options in your connection definition:
----
connections {

  transport-connmark {
    # ...
    children {
      transport-connmark {
        mode = transport
        mark = %unique
        #...
      }
    }
  }
----

A unique mark per negotiated SA is required so that the SAs can be distinguished.
The plugin automatically configures Netfilter rules in the `*mangle*` table to
apply and restore the marks.

== Netfilter Rules and connmark

To find the correct return path for a protected upper layer connection,
Netfilter connmarks in the `*mangle*` table are used.

In `*PREROUTING*` a gateway applies the unique mark assigned to the SA to the
packet. This makes sure the IPsec policy actually matches, as we require the
correct mark for a policy match. For non-NAT situations, ESP matching is used
to MARK packets, for NAT situations the packets get selected based on UDP
encapsulation ports.

In the `*INPUT*` chain IPsec policy matching is used to apply the IPsec policy
mark as a `*CONNMARK*`. This basically copies the IPsec policy mark to the
conntrack entry, so it can later be restored.

On the `*OUTPUT*` chain the `*CONNMARK*` target is used to to restore the mark
from the conntrack entry to the packet. This ensures that the correct mark is
applied to select the SA from the same pair that has been used during inbound
processing.

The rules installed by the plugin for two clients behind the same NAT router
looks something like:
----
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 82 packets, 16106 bytes)
 pkts bytes target    prot opt in out  source       destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 91 packets, 17770 bytes)

== Windows L2TP

The Windows L2TP client always uses `udp/1701` as source and destination ports.
Unfortunately conntrack can't properly track these udp streams when clients are
behind the same NAT. Because all streams have identical `*src/dst*` tuples, the
flow can't be separated and only one conntrack entry will exist. Only traffic to
the client that last sent an inbound packet is active as all outbound packets
will be set to the same mark (and thus be returned over the same SA). A solution
might be for a L2TP daemon to track which mark belongs to which client and set
correct marks on the outgoing packets. Together with Connmark plugin this would
make 2 Windows hosts behind the same NAT successfully use L2TP.

An experimental patch for `*xl2tpd*` can be found in the
{XL2TPD}[xl2tpd Github issue 82]
