== Purpose

The `*eap-tls*` plugin for `*libcharon*`  supports EAP-TLS authentication.
EAP-TLS uses a TLS handshake to mutually authenticate client and server (or an
AAA backend) based on X.509 certificates.

While EAP-TLS is a secure and very flexible protocol, it is rather slow when
used over IKE. Depending on the fragment and certificate size, it requires 6-10
additional IKE exchanges compared to traditional IKEv2 certificate authentication.
But there are other reasons to use EAP-TLS, such as Windows 7 smartcard based
authentication or if you require certificate authentication against a
centralized AAA backend server.

As EAP-TLS authenticates the client and the EAP server mutually, it is possible
to skip IKEv2 server authentication and use the EAP-only authentication mechanism.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-eap-tls

== Compatibility

The EAP-TLS backend uses its own TLS stack shipped with strongSwan. This stack
supports TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 and has been tested against:

- OpenSSL 0.9.8 server via FreeRADIUS EAP-TLS (TLS 1.0)
- Windows 7 client via IKEv2 EAP-TLS (TLS 1.0)
- Windows 7 client via IE9 (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)
- GnuTLS server via Apache mod_gnutls (TLS 1.1)
- NSS client via Firefox 3.6.8 (TLS 1.0)
- Self (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)

== Configuration

=== Connections

EAP-TLS is configured as any other EAP method. The client uses

 connections.<conn>.local.auth = eap

and the server selects EAP-TLS for the client using

 connections.<conn>.remote.auth = eap-tls

strongSwan supports AAA servers via xref:./eap-radius.adoc[RADIUS], i.e.

 connections.<conn>.remote.auth = eap-radius

also works in conjunction with EAP-TLS.

By default the VPN gateway uses IKEv2 certificate authentication to prove its
identity to the clients. But as EAP-TLS is a mutual authentication protocol,
`EAP-only` authentication can be used by specifying

 connections.<conn>.local.auth = eap

on the gateway side.

Certificates for EAP-TLS are configured the same way as for traditional IKEv2
certificate-based authentication, using the
xref:swanctl/swanctlDir.adoc[`*swanctl*`] certificate and key directories as
well as the xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`] definitions

 connections.<conn>.local.certs

and

 connections.<conn>.remote.certs

on VPN client and gateway, respectively. CRL and OCSP revocation is supported by
TLS, too.

For authentication against an AAA backend server, the VPN gateway usually uses a
different identity via IKE than the AAA backend via EAP. To specify a different
AAA identity on the client use the xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]
attribute

 connections.<conn>.local.aaa_id

It defaults to the IKEv2 identity defined by

 connections.<conn>.remote.id

A VPN gateway terminating the EAP-TLS authentication locally may use the
`*aaa_id*` within EAP-TLS but requires a certificate with such a subject or
subjectAltName.

=== EAP-TLS Options

The `*eap-tls*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_tls[`*charon.plugins.eap-tls*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

=== TLS Options

The `*eap-tls*` plugin uses the strongSwan `*libtls*` library that can be
configured and fine-tuned with the following xref:config/tlsOptions.adoc[TLS options].
