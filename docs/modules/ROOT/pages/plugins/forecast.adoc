= forecast Plugin

:TESTS: https://www.strongswan.org/testing/testresults6
:EX:    {TESTS}/ikev2/forecast

== Purpose

The `*forecast*` plugin for `*libcharon*` uses Linux Netfilter marks to allow
identical IPsec policies having multicast or broadcast selectors and uses a
listen-and-forward mechanism to forward such traffic over all matching SAs. It
supports forwarding of multi/broadcast traffic between multiple connected clients
and between clients and a LAN attached to the IPsec gateway.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-forecast

Building the plugin requires `*iptables*` development headers to be installed.

== Configuration

The `*forecast*` plugin currently is used on any SA negotiated that uses a
unique mark. To configure such a connection as responder, set a unique mark and
don't forget to include the broadcast/multicast selectors that you want to forward:
----
connections {

  mc-bc {
    # ...
    children {
      mc-bc {
        local_ts  = 10.1.0.0/16,224.0.0.0/4
        remote_ts = dynamic,224.0.0.0/4,10.1.255.255
        mark = %unique
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The `*local_ts*` shall include the local network and any multicast address to
tunnel but can also be `*0.0.0.0/0*`. The `*remote_ts*` can include multicast
addresses as well and the required broadcast addresses. Don't forget to include
the default `*dynamic*` selector if a virtual IP address is assigned to the client.

A unique mark per negotiated SA is required, so the SAs can be distinguished.
The plugin automatically configures Netfilter rules in the `*mangle*` table to
send multicast/broadcast packets over multiple SAs.

The plugin also uses additional global options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_forecast[`*charon.plugins.forecast*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

== Netfilter Rules and Marks

In `PREROUTING` a gateway applies the unique mark assigned to the SA to the
packet. This makes sure the IPsec policy actually matches, as we require the
correct mark for a policy match. For non-NAT situations, ESP matching is used to
`*MARK*` packets, for NAT situations the packets get selected based on UDP
encapsulation ports.

Additionally, `PREROUTING` rules get installed to set the mark on decapsulated
traffic matching any policy.

On the `OUTPUT` chain, the `*MARK*` target is used to set the mark to match the
appropriate IPsec policy.

The rules installed by the plugin for two clients looks something like:
----
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 55 packets, 8648 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination
    1   112 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.130   MARK set 0x2
    3   488 MARK    esp  --  *  *    192.168.0.200   192.168.0.1  esp spi:3242273483 MARK set 0x2
    1   112 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.129   MARK set 0x1
    3   488 MAR     esp  --  *  *    192.168.0.100   192.168.0.1  esp spi:3416575175 MARK set 0x1

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 50 packets, 8172 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 65 packets, 10840 bytes)
 pkts bytes target  prot opt in out  source          destination
    0     0 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.130   MARK set 0x2
    0     0 MARK    all  --  *  *    0.0.0.0/0       10.1.0.129   MARK set 0x1
----

In certain situations (e.g. if there is NAT on the host itself), it might be
necessary to manually add rules that use the `*CONNMARK*` target to properly
mark return traffic.
