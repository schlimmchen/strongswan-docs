= eap-dynamic Plugin

:TESTS: https://www.strongswan.org/testing/testresults6
:EX:    {TESTS}/ikev2/rw-eap-dynamic

== Purpose

The `*eap-dynamic*` plugin for `*libcharon*` acts as a proxy that dynamically
selects an EAP method that is supported/preferred by the client. If the original
EAP method initiated by the plugin is rejected with an `*EAP-NAK*` message, it
will select a different method that is supported/requested by the client.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-eap-dynamic

You also need to enable actual EAP methods, such as `*eap-md5*`, `*eap-mschapv2*`
or `*eap-tls*`.

== Configuration

The `*eap-dynamic*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_eap_dynamic[`*charon.plugins.eap-dynamic*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

== Client Behavior

Irrespective of whether the plugin is enabled or not, strongSwan will send an
`*EAP-NAK*` message if the server initiates an EAP method that the client doesn't
support. Clients may also request a specific EAP method by configuring that
method with in the xref:swanctl/swanctlConf.adoc[`*swanctl.conf*`]

 connections.<conn>.local.auth = eap-<method>

The `*EAP-NAK*` will then only contain that method, otherwise all supported
methods are included.
