== Purpose

The `*xauth-eap*` plugin for `*libcharon*` is an IKEv1 XAuth server backend. It
requests username/password XAuth credentials and verifies them against any
password based IKEv2 EAP plugin. By default it uses the
xref:./eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] plugin. This enables the client to
authenticate against an AAA using EAP, as it is done with IKEv2. The server acts
as EAP client to the AAA:

 Client <--- IKEv1/Xauth ---> Server <--- RADIUS/EAP ---> AAA

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-xauth-eap

Additionally the `*eap-radius*` plugin (`--enable-eap-radius`) and and an EAP
method like for example `*eap-md5*` (`--enable-eap-md5`) are needed on the Server.


The xref:./eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] in itself has an integrated
xref:./eap-radius.adoc#_xauth_via_radius[`*XAuth*`] that can directly verify
XAuth credentials using `*User-Name*` and `*User-Password*` RADIUS attributes,
which is sufficient for most setups. Some installations might still prefer
the `*xauth-eap* + *eap-radius*` combination, e.g. to have a single RADIUS
configuration for both IKEv1 and IKEv2, or to add additional protection to
passwords between the NAS and the AAA.

== Configuration

The `*xauth-eap*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_xauth_eap[`*charon.plugins.xauth-eap*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

|===

Any EAP backend could be used but xref:./eap-radius.adoc[`*eap-radius*`] is what
this plugin was designed for. The AAA server will select the EAP method used for
authentication. The server needs support for this EAP method, as it acts as an
EAP client on behalf of the IKE client.

== Connections

To authenticate clients with this backend, set:
----
connections {
  <conn>: {
    remote-rsa {
      auth = pubkey
    }
    remote-xauth {
      auth = xauth-eap
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }
}
----
for traditional `*XAuth*` plus RSA. For Hybrid authentication, use
----
connections {
  <conn>: {
    remote {
      auth = xauth-eap
    }
    version = 1
    # ...
  }
}
----
