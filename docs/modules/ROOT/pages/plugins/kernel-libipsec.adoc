== Purpose

The `*kernel-libipsec*` plugin for `*libcharon*` provides an IPsec backend that
works entirely in userland, using TUN devices and our own `*libipsec*` IPsec
implementation, see {GITHUB}/src/libipsec/[`src/libipsec`].

Both other kernel interfaces, `*kernel-netlink*` (the default) and `*kernel-pfkey*`,
install IPsec SAs in the operating system's IPsec stack. This plugin provides an
alternative, for instance, if the OS implementation does not support a required
algorithm (e.g. AES-GCM on macOS). However, it generally performs worse than
the OS kernel's IPsec stack. In particular, when handling a lot of SAs and/or
traffic, thus it is **not recommended to be used on security gateways**.

The plugin is disabled by default and can be enabled with the
xref:install/autoconf.adoc[`*./configure*`] option

 --enable-kernel-libipsec

A network kernel backend is still required, so either the `*kernel-netlink*` or
the `*kernel-pfroute*` plugin has to be enabled, too.

== Behavior

With the plugin enabled a TUN device is created on startup that will be used to
handle cleartext traffic from and to the host. For each IPsec SA routes get
installed that direct traffic to the TUN device, from there the plugin reads the
cleartext packets and encrypts them via `*libipsec*`. The resulting ESP packets
will be sent over the UDP sockets the daemon uses for IKE traffic, which is why
*the plugin currently only works with UDP encapsulation (NAT-T) enabled*.
Encapsulated ESP packets that are received on the daemon's UDP socket are
decrypted by `*libipsec*` and then injected via TUN device. `*libipsec*` can use
all ciphers supported for IKE to encrypt and authenticate traffic.

NOTE: `*libipsec*` is not intended for scenarios with high amounts of traffic or
      high burst traffic. It is not optimized for performance and buffers each
      packet in memory. In combination with insufficient processor power this
      will lead to a out of memory condition and a crash of charon or the whole
      device. SA and policy lookups are also not particularly optimized.

On systems that use the `*kernel-pfroute*` plugin (xref:os/freebsd.adoc[FreeBSD]
or xref:os/macos.adoc[macOS]) a separate TUN device will be created for each
xref:features/vip.adoc[virtual IP]. On Linux this is not required.

== Configuration

The `*kernel-libipsec*` plugin is configured using the following options in the
xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc#_charon_plugins_kernel_libipsec[`*charon.plugins.kernel-libipsec*`]
section of xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`]:

== Host-to-Host Tunnels

If the IKE peer is included in the remote traffic selector a separate route is
installed that excepts such traffic from the route via TUN device to allow
further IKE traffic between the peers (otherwise a routing loop would ensue).
But if the remote traffic selector *equals* the IKE peer this won't work anymore.
Therefore such traffic selectors are not allowed by default.

It is possible to use such traffic selectors on newer Linux hosts by using
`*fwmark*` options with the `*kernel-netlink*` and `*socket-default*` plugins.

The relevant xref:config/strongswanConf.adoc[`*strongswan.conf*`] options are as
follows:
----
charon {
  plugins {
    kernel-netlink {
      fwmark = !0x42
    }
    socket-default {
      fwmark = 0x42
    }
    kernel-libipsec {
      allow_peer_ts = yes
    }
  }
}
----

* The first option configures the routing rule for strongSwan's own routing table
  in such a way that the routes in that table will only apply to packets that
  *do not* feature the configured `*fwmark*` (`*0x42*` in the example above).

* The second option forces an `*fwmark*` of `*0x42*` on all packets sent by the
  IKE daemon. This includes IKE packets but also the UDP encapsulated ESP packets
  that are sent over that socket. Such traffic is now not affected by the routes
  (via TUN device) installed by strongSwan in its own routing table.

* The third option finally enables negotiation of host-to-host tunnels.

To make the Linux kernel actually consider the routes as required the
`*net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter*` setting has to be set:

 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=2

Read the {SYSCTL}[documentation] about this setting to understand the impact.
It basically disables the `*rp_filter*` You possibly need to alter your local
firewall rules to plug a hole caused by changing the setting.
